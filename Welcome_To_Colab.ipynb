I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge amazon kindle is always the best ebook, upgrade every new model It\\'s beyond my expectation, and it can even show music score. Not fast turning though. If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you\\'re looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy. Love my kindle, makes reading at night so easy and it feels like you are reading a real book. Good product for child. Who only need to read the books This Kindle is a convenient size yet lettering is easy to read. I use this every day on my commute. Great battery life, no backlight but very readable with normal lighting. I like the built in dictionary. Email yourself pdf or mobi files for easy transfers. It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it\\'s difficult to read because screen is not too bright Great product for myself! And I bought it when there was great deal on it! Item work well and was easy to read from in day light Great product and service will refer to a friend. And the sales man r good Everything is great except that i can\\'t read external pdfs properly. Either it zooms too much of too little. For kindle books it provides great experience. Battery life is awesome! I was looking for a kindle whitepaper. I saw online for $80. What a deal. I ordered it on line and picked it up in the store. I got it home and couldn\\'t adjust the brightness. After a lengthy time with online customer service I called customer service. After 20 minuets with speaking to a female Elmer Fud that doesn\\'t speak english well I figured I would just return it. Although it looks Identical to the $120 model, you can not adjust the brightness. That would have been good information before I bought it. This is a nice bare-bones reading device. Easy to set up and use. My greatest issue is that it isn\\'t back lit so it can\\'t be used w/o a light on in the room. Returning it an purchasing a paperwhite instead. Easy to use and navigate, purchasing books is fast and simple and I love the fact that I can password protect this device The Amazon Kindle is light weight and easy to use. I love hear readers, I had to replace mine because I destroyed the last, but it is awesome Love the simplicity. Also love that I use it for reading only and can\\'t download distracting apps. My husband loves this Kindle. He has a muscular disease keeping him from being able to handle anything with much weight at all. This is perfect. I\\'ve wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when BB put it on sale. I am not disappointed. I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations. I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books. My fianc√©e really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend. Simple, great buy for your money if you are an avid reader. I like the changes that have been made since my current 4 year old unit was purchased Fits nicely in your hand and its touchable. increase the size of the fonts Great buy, do a lot of reading and he no glear screen is awesome while in the sun. I lie the size and weight for the kindle-makes it very convenient to take large books with me in digital format. Great price and works great for book reading. Would recommend Got it when it was on sale. Totally fall in love with it. Bring with it me everywhere. I never used kindle before. My wife gifted me on my birthday. This is the amazing product. I am using it for daily reading. The display is fantastic and no strain on eyes. I bought this with paper white and didn‚Äôt see much of a difference in terms of resolution and use. I totally recommend this reader as it‚Äôs so small and powerful! The sales people are really nice and knowledgeable to me I will come back again I\\'m a longtime Kindle user and jumped at the opportunity to bring my granddaughter into the fold with this gift. She loved it! Overall good product, does what is advertised, comfortable to use. The kindle has come in very handy lately, I always have a book to read and this is great to just grab on the go. Battery life is great, only drawback is no backlight. I am loving my new Kindle! I have wanted one for a while and finally bought one, and even though it was the cheapest one, it has exceeded my expectations. I love how there is no glare. I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons. Bought this for my 90+ year-old, totally no-tech mom. Her first e-book is Gone with the Wind. She likes the size and ease of use. Amazon kindle products have always been reliable, consistent quality and this is no different. Very happy with it. working well and very cheap if we think in the price way The battery doesn\\'t last as long as was advertised, if you have the money I would recommend the backlit model. This Kindle doesn\\'t have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model. It\\'s exactly what I needed, nothing more, nothing less. I\\'ve had no problems with the reader at all so far so I\\'ll give it 5 stars. The kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading After the first one stopped working after only 3 weeks-best Buy replaced it with no fuss and it\\'s going great. Small, lightweight (so fits in a purse/handbag) and with the anti-glare screen you can read in direct sunlight I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet. Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use! I bought this as a gift to my dad and he loves it. Well worth if you dont plan on reading in dark. the future of reading you just have this and it is like a whole library I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update. This is a great way to read books on the go. There\\'s no backlight, so reading in darker rooms may be hard. But it\\'s affordable and portable and a great way to take all your books with you. I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle. i bought this as a backup. I am currently using the same headphone. We got the Kindle for our daughter who accompanied us to try out the two Kindle models. We were willing to buy either one and we assumed she would want the more expensive one with the backlighting feature. But as she tried both, she gravitated with certainty toward the basic model. \"Why would U want to read in the dark?\" She said. As the weeks and months have gone by, she says she\\'s completely happy with the basic Kindle, it\\'s exactly what she wanted. Perfect. Good, able to read under bright sunlight conditions too Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient I purchased this product because I love to read and buying books got costly. With this product I can read all I want for 10.00 a month it is smaller than i thought but it gets the job done. Love my new Kindle! I hadn\\'t read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up. Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models. Kindle is the perfect E-reader. Easy to use and size is perfect to bring \\'book\\' on the go. Easy to use and it arrived exactly as described. Good beginner device for youngsters who want a device to read from. Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn\\'t backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference. Target made the experience pleasant. My fiance really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend. For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn\\'t have a back light so I\\'m unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire. It is still the best device for buying books and reading them. However, go with kindle paperwhite if you read books in dark places. Great product and service and the sales man r really nice. When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book. My wife loves it, replaces a Kindle from like 2003. It\\'s small, light, and easy to read from. I just wish I would have spent the extra 30 bucks and got the paperwhite. The more i use this one the more I wish I had the option of a backlight. If you\\'re on the fence as I was, go with the paperwhite! However if the backlight is not an issue, this device is great and I would recommend it. This device is good for entry level reader only in daylight.Its doesnot support reading in dark. To read in dark you will have to purchase a light or cover case with light attached. I either case it will put a lot of strain in your eyes. I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don\\'t mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle. it would not load my books proper. took a dozen tries erasing an dreregistering. screen too dark I bought this for my daughter. It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family. The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. In fact, those of us with older model Kindles are jealous. This is a pretty cool little device. Im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience. Only drawback is I wish it had more storage. But for the price, it works good. Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional. As always, great job! Very easy to use and it\\'s always with me. Only problem I have is the button on the bottom is touchy, but not really an issue. Keep up the good work I especially like the Amazon has a system to convert pdf to kindle format. Some of the things I read (journal articles) are in pdf format and I can email them to my kindle email and it shows up on my kindle with kindle format (larger text). You can find your kindel email at your account information. Only thing, I would have like a screen little larger. Im happy to have it. Very comfortable and easy to use every where This is my eighth Kindle. Some others were either lost or screen-damaged. I bought it as a spare. Current model is better looking than earlier versions (white case), sturdier, and has an improved screen. Great price also; wish I\\'d bought two. My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift. Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study. Excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling. I love my Kindle! I\\'m back to reading so much more often as I always have several books with me at all times! At first it surprised me that this version doesn\\'t have a back light and you need a light to read, but I actually like it now as I don\\'t get the eye strain like I do when using my phone. I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it\\'s less bright on the eyes. It\\'s a perfect gift for young adult during the holiday session. The screen is too dark, and cannot adjust the brightness I should have purchased a kindle sooner. It\\'s easy to use and I love it! This was purchased as a gift and they\\'ve absolutely loved it. Great Gift for anyone. Very easy to setup. Coexist with all IOT Devices. Alexa is AWESOME! Super excited to give this as a gift. It\\'s super convenient that Best Buy has Echo products in store instead of having to purchase from Amazon. We bought this for mother in law, buying another for me. Well designed, good sound, has everything Alexa has plus the HD video. Always ready with answers with associated video or text if applicable. Can show movie trailers, can also watch Amazon video. Excellent on-demand security video with Amazon compatible cameras. Voice activated message and/or video calls to Amazon Show owners or Alexa App holders. Highly recommended. I have one Alexa and three Echo dots and having Echo Show now is awesome! Omg I love my amazon show it is sooo cool and does a lot of cool stuff Great looking design. Amazon Echo Show was easy to set up and use. The product is very entertaining and useful. Would recommend it to anyone. Got it for few weeks but it kind of fades away from your life. This device is awesome ‚Äò really lets you get very excited about smart home technology ‚Äò I‚Äôm buying a second one for my upstairs I purchased this for my daughter and when I tell you she was so happy she hugged the box then me and back to the box! Overall product is excellent. Speakers should have a capability to be used as Bluetooth speakers like the echo. I have the spot, dot and two shows, I started out with the spot and loved it so much I wanted a bigger one. This was a (Best Buy) ! No pun intended lol I was a little hesitant to spend the money to get this but I am so glad I did! Alexa always answers when I say the commands and I have noticed it is probably 95% right with any command that I have given. Love the fact that I can see things on the screen. Some of my news briefings have a picture/video so that\\'s nice too. We also love the video call option. Planning on getting one for my grandma who is not as technologically advanced, and could just sit at a table and talk with the grandkids. Worth every penny. Great product, very much recommended. Service at Best buy is always the best I bought 2 of these for gifts. I love my Echo and think the new one will be incredible too! After the holidays, I will buy one for myself! I can watch videos, check my security cameras, and grey two for a fantastic price Dreams need topics, song lyrics scroll during song play, watch movies/trailers and etc. With it, if you can get it on sale, bought my for special deal at Best Buy for $129.99. not sure if the value is there at the regular price of$249.99. but it is very cool device. information on weather, updates on music, events. Fun questions answered while working in kitchen. Good sound for a limited areaGreat sales assistance at Best Buy bought for christmas present for son and family so we can communicate visually. The Amazon echo is excellent. Easy to set up, and we now use it to automate the entire house from our air-conditioning thermostat to every light in the house with the Phillips hue bulbs. We went and got one for everyone in our family. I have both an Amazon Echo and Amazon Show and prefer the Show with the video screen. I use the Show to display recipes when cooking, lyrics to the music I‚Äôm listening to and video conferencing with my family. I like seeing headlines of stories scroll across the screen along with the t8me and temperature. I have only been using my Amazon Echo Show for a couple days now but it works great. The microphone picks up my voice very easily, the sound quality is great, and it looks nice sitting on my coffee table! this echo show lets you see so much, great item for your home! The Echo is very easy to use and has features that allow users to converse easily with others who may have a hard time learning how to communicate using newer videophone technology. This product removes those barriers. I love my echo show I wish you could watch movies or tc shows or you tube so hopefully they will add that soon. Love all my Echo products and this one is exceptional as well. Was able to look in my house while away. Waiting for more update for access to apps in the future. Little putsy so far, but there are continuous updates that I think will make this a great device to stay connected with family. Bought a second for my dad. Who knows, he might replace his land line someday if this gets better. I do think our original Echo is a bit better at responding, but I enjoy this one in the kitchen /aka hub of the house. It\\'s at its heart an echo, but having a screen on it, with 1000s of things to do with it make it a much easier recommendation over the simarly priced screenless echo plus Amazon - Echo Show is the best of all my Amazon products. I love the hands-free but able to see things on the screen. I have 2 of these in my house work great I just bought 4 for Christmas gifts for my family We love Alexa! Love being able to watch news briefings, seeing the lyrics to songs, and so much more! It\\'s in our kitchen and we use it everyday! The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though. It‚Äôs awesome being able to control the lighting and lots of other controls with this! I‚Äôm a big echo fan, so this seemed like a no brainer. I like it a lot, but I‚Äôm disappointed about google pulling YouTube functionality. I also feel like the original echo speaker sounded a little better and listened better with kitchen related background noise. I was jealous when our son showed us his Amazon Show and some of the things it was capable of doing. Since AOL eliminated Instant Messaging, my wife and I were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors. So we got two Shows and two Spots and now not only can intercom easily but use Alexa for music and many other things. We will probably start using some smart home devices which Alexa can also control. It\\'s a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time. We use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera! Works great we tell it to show us the camera ,and boom, there‚Äôs the video feed. Super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show!! We use echo almost every day. It is fun to ask questions. The music is great. We check the weather and listen to NPRnews Love playing music and talking to Alexa and looking at my camera three the screen I love the Echo Show and this is the 3rd one I have purchased (two were presents for family at Christmas). This one was for me. I love being able to hear music, connect with family via video and ask Alexa questions. Best purchase I could have made! Awesome sound which was unexpected. It\\'s nice seeing info on the screen such as recipes, song lyrics, weather, etc. I love the capability to see it on the screen and it allows me to not have to use my hands. Screen is really nice great for videos I would definetly recommend it We bought the two-for deal as presents. My mother will have a learning curve, but since the other one is going to my son, he can teach her! Looks like a neat appliance, but want to see if it can do more than weather, music and turning off the lights... By far my favorite Amazon product. I bought one for every bedroom in the home. Very fun to have music at the ready with a voice command. We use it with Amazon Unlimited which has nearly everything. Good to view recipes with Allrecipes, so we keep it in the kitchen for reference and musical ambience. The video is good too, it has youtube functionality. It would be nice to have regular tv though, but that is probably on the providers for now.. nice to have the photo background and lastly, to have lyrics on the screen when music is played! I was using the original Echo seldomly. Then I decided to get the Show... I use the Show a lot more. Was simple to set up and you can make calls with video. Great product I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon , i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code, nothing... then a nother one... and still nothing , i started to set up the device at 8.30 am and by 11.20 am i was fed up with it.. i had to step away.... after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon .... My dad uses this as a speaker for the tv ...and loves it. He does use it in the traditional Alexa way...but the speaker option he discovered is an added benefit. Alexa runs my entire house. The Echo show is a great addition to the Echo family. Everyone needs one! Replaced a regular echo with this unit. Allows video chat with our son in college and replaces a digital picture frame at a very affordable price. We love the echo show. Best feature is the flash bringing that gives us a rundown on news and weather each morning. My girlfriend loves the echo show, I bought two of them... Along with fire TV, a prime membership, an amazon music subscription, other home automation devices and the Alexa app on the phone this system is very functional. It‚Äôs Alexa, but it has a screen, and it sounds pretty decent for a countertop device. My wife loves having it in the kitchen for recipes, weather music and fun! I purchased this as present for a friend and since I have an Echo I can video chat with her to check in. The quality of the video is great. Like having another person in the house, I talk to Alexa more then my wife I really love it I use it everyday and it works great We struggled with a surprise Christmas gift this year. The store sales rep suggested this and it was a hit! The Echo Show is a game changer, it\\'s amazing as are all the Echo\\'s but with this one you can watch video\\'s, or see who\\'s at your door. The things that Echo can do are limitless, it\\'s like having a personal assistant. Another great product by Amazon, super fun and great for entertaining the family and guests. Great product fun to use. Very easy to set up and begin useing Gift for a relative they said they loved the gift. Same as echo but with a screen which adds to the appeal to this product. Purchased this because I was buying the echo dot for my daughter and thought this would be fun for the family. We play music every day on it. Every one in the family is enjoying it. Only dislike is that it doesn‚Äôt have the hub. I live the echo show! So easy to set up and use. I have one in the kitchen and one in our main bathroom. Alexa may be new, but I would have thought some of the simple commands she would have been able to respond to already. For the amount Amazon charges, it should come with better instructions, including what specifically to download into one\\'s device (iPhone, etc.) so as to make some apps ready to go. Amazon dropped the ball on this one. I previously owned a Nucleus device which was similar to this device but was not a great device and had a lot of bugs and did not do much so I returned it. This device is a masterpiece! Not only is it tied into the Alexa Echo universe, it can be used as an intercom throughout your house with other Echos and also can be used to view things and even call people that have Echo directly. It is an amazing piece of hardware and Amazon should be proud of themselves for developing such a beautiful device! I love the echo show it is in my kitchen and we use it almost daily to listen to music while we cook and also to find new recipes to try, my kids use it to help with homework, my whole family uses it with ease and everyone loves it. Love it took the place off the echo in my bedroom. Fantastic product and does exactly as described. Great gift idea! We really like that when you call someone you can FaceTime with them! I bought it as a gift for my parents and they absolutely love it! We love that even our four year old can tell Alexa to \"call papa\" or Alexa turn on the kitchen lights! I find myself saying to my phone, \"Alexa, play.........\". I wish they made it for my car too. Love how the echo show integrates with smart house devices and cameras. I use it to view our cameras, listen to music, make phone calls/video calls and even as a recipe guide when cooking. I‚Äôve been very impressed! Not going to lie - we haven‚Äôt even opened it yet. Planning on getting it all setup tomorrow night. I did see it at the store though & it was incredible I like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports, etc. Still not using it to its full potential, but we have it controlling a couple of lamps, giving us weather reports, setting timers and alarms. It\\'s making me lazy! Sometimes it doesn\\'t hear my voice. Hears my husband\\'s voice better. I find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table. Love this. Just replaced my old echo with this one. Love Alexa. I recently purchased the Amazon show. It was easy to setup and use and I also added my own specialty screens and home screen. Extremely glad I bought it. we enjoy asking it questions about history & educational stuff for kids. I LOVE MY ECHO SHOW, ELEXA IS SO HELPFULL SHE ANSWERS JUST ABOUT EVERY QUESTION I HAVE I have the echo and a dot. This is great for video calling and intercom calling in the house. Use it every day. I run all my photo‚Äôs stored on Amazon prime and for music. What a treat! What‚Äôs the weather forecast? What‚Äôs the news this morning?? Just about all you need to know - plus Smart home control!! I purchased this for my children who are separated by miles. Can\\'t wait for them to open their gifts The Amazon Echo Show is a great addition to any connected home. Allows me to link Phillips Hue and Nest systems to control with voice. Great display and available information is awesome. Worked as advertised - easy to set up and link to my wi-fi. I love how you are able to get a visual effect along with audio from Alexa I think it is worth the sale price of $150.00 but it has limitations. For example it shows my calendar but you can only see the first item, then if you ask for more, you see the next 3 or so. I The screen is updating with trivia...some interesting some not so much. I bet the next generation is a lot better Everyone should have this product. It‚Äôs great to have when you are needing to see something and your hands are full or you can‚Äôt find your phone. When I first read about Amazon Echo Show, I thought the sound quality would be inferior to Echo because of the small size, which to me would be a deal breaker. I read that the sound is actually superior to Echo & it is compatible with most existing security cameras, so I decided to buy one. Then Best Buy ran a strong promotion if you buy 2, so I caved and bought 2. (I have a number of Echo\\'s and 2) Echo Dots in the house). I am completely BLOWN AWAY by Echo Show!! Here is a brief summary of thoughts: LIKES: 1- Substantially the Best Sound Quality of any Echo to date, with stronger bass, directional stereo, Dolby Audio & focused sound field to the front. You can rock out louder, with less sound to the sides & back, so you do not share your music to all, as does the Echo.2- The 8) Far Field microphones are more effective than Echo. 3- High resolution 7\" screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen. 4- Song lyrics are great! (Free optional setting to turn on lyrics). 5- Photos of the album cover & the band on all music are awesome! 6- 3) buttons on top: Mute / Camera Defeat with red on screen indicator; Volume UP & Volume Down. 7- Excellent resolution with built-in camera. 8- Auto presence detector turns Show screen on when you are detected. 9- Speak to Alexa, just as with Echo or Dot, & Show mutes the volume & shows what you asked on the screen, with the music volume lowered in the background. 10- Ask the forecast & you get written & verbal forecast. You also get a second screen showing the next 4 days, including real feel, a picture of the anticipated weather, chance of rain, etc. 11- Say: Alexa, show me the \"Front Porch\", or any of the numerous security cameras & within 2 seconds, there is a highly detailed live video with sound! 12- Video conference - I do not know anyone else with Show yet, so I cannot try this but call yourself & you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings. 13- Uses the same power supply as Amazon Echo. 14- Sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings (see photo of Show in the center of the desk with 2) 4K monitors & iPad Pro). 15- The touch screen sensitivity is perfect. 16- Build quality is First Rate! 17- Rubber feet protect any surface & are anti - slip. 18- Addictive! More than any other device, this is one you will want in the center of your desk, as shown in my photo, because once you add the video component, you will wonder how you enjoyed music, sports, & just about everything, without it! 19- See your shopping list. 20- See visual confirmation that the lights you ask Alexa to turn on actually turned on. DISLIKES: NONE! I would only offer one design option. I would offer an optional Amazon Echo Show Wireless Subwoofer for this beast, that you could buy later. It would work like the many Soundbars that include a Wireless Sub. That would allow SHOW to not only ROCK OUT, but to shake the walls at the same time!I am seriously planning to sell some Echos & Dots to pick up a couple more Shows. They are GREAT!! This is actually for a gift. Second one I purchased But great priduct I‚Äôve asked itquestions and answers were unknown and could not help me Great product. Easy to use .very easy to set up .. This product is great and a nice addition to the echo family. Connects with Echo Dot and Bluetooth with ease. Works great We love our echo. Use it everyday. One thing, it claims to pick up your voice from anywhere in the room, but that\\'s not always the case. It\\'s not a big deal, just get a little closer or louder and she follows the request/answers the question. Love it! Nice add on to work with Arlo pro cams or if you like to sing karaoke with alexa At first I was concerned with the funny looking angle I saw on the pictures. The item was not displayed at the local store so I decided to take a chance. As an owner of the Echo Dot i figured it would work in the same manner and it does. I love that it works with the Arlo Pro. The screen is great and I soon figured out the reason for the funny angle of the item. The angled screen works great Only setback or recommendation would be to add a auxiliary output at the rear. Also you can watch prime movies, YouTube videos etc. I bought the white version and have it in the kitchen. I use it for EVERYTHING, music, video, phone, security cams, news, weather. It\\'s the perfect kitchen assistant. This Alexa is the best one out of all them due to the screen feature I love everything about this Alexa... if you‚Äôre on the fence.. just buy it.. it does everything!!! If you like the Amazon Echo or the echo Dot you will love this for me the best part is when you make list or listen to music it puts the words on the screen for you For some time I have been searching for a replacement for my Sony DASH which had support discontinued recently. While I am sure that being a bedside \"smart\" alarm clock was not the primary goal of the Echo Show it does fit the bill nicely. This was my first Echo purchase and now I have multiple Echo\\'s and HUE lights. Great system all around! She is Alexa, better younger sister. Love her, and some of the new skills great The show has a good picture and good sound...love using it to look things up This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both. I\\'ve being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos. The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time. This Echo Show comes in handy. I use it almost as much as I thought I would. I am still learning all that it can do, but my favorite part is the screen. It‚Äôs not a huge deal, but if I could change one thing it would be a detachable power cable instead of hardwired. It‚Äôs good, but not google smart, it answers when no one asks. Kind of spooky. The distinction in the voice context is absent I like the ease and usage of the amazon show. I have a amazon echo and I decided to upgrade to this for the video call. Overall great product! I have been transforming my house to a smart home. So far thus is my favorite. Does so much I learn more each day The visuals entice utilizing the product with greater frequency. Easy to set up and works well. There should be a manual to accompany the product. Going online encourages the purchase of a book of directions, rather than a simple online manual. I enjoy getting recipes and news via Alexa. Great speakers. I bought the echo after seeing it demonstrated by my brother. He proceeded to ask Alexa questions and Alexa would answer them immediately. He then asked it to pull up some songs which, it did right away. Then he asked it to call mom and it did that as well. Needless to say, i had to get one. I like the video feature for my doorbell. Wish it automatically showed a picture when door bell rung. Does not FaceTime. Maybe later. Also not all cameras are compatible. no problems so far I\\'m enjoying it. suggestion : it should come with some outputs plugs to connect it to bigger speakers / sound system We love it to control the whole house lighting with Phillips Hue bulbs, as well as just everyday use for alarms, reminders, questions, news and even adjusting A/C, and Pandora Music Playlists. Bought one for my family as well. This is not my first Echo product - we have 3 Echo dots. This is a step up for us. I have it placed in the kitchen and love it! The sound is outstanding and I love the screen feature. I will be buying additional ones for family as well as myself. Love this new Echo Show.The best in the Alexa family almost a week late from release date from ups but finally got this and set it up which was easy, Once in a while it doesn\\'t hear you right but that\\'s probably due to being 10 - 15 feet away with the tv on other than that no problems This item was purchased as a gift for an annual holiday party. The recipient loved it. I am starting my smart home and this was an addition to what we had already which was the dot and echo. This is simple to set up and the kids can even control it!! We bought this to view our Arlo Pro cameras on something other than our iPhones. The Show does a great job of this. It is a fantastic Alexa device. My minor complaints are that it is slightly smaller than expected and you can‚Äôt view YouTube videos on it. Not huge deals at all, but minutely disappointing. This is awesome and the sound is amazing, the screen is outstanding Very neat item, fun to talk to. Easy set up to use. You can play trivia with your family and learn a lot about the world Love it , it‚Äôs my second Alexa it‚Äôs conceted to everything in my house thinking about buying more The ease of use and comparability with Smart Home products make a this an awesome product . I‚Äôve had Amazon Alexa since she first hit the streets over two years ago and Echo Show is awesome! It can do so much more than Alexa and Echo Dot! You will love it! This is the favorite of the house, even our visitors love it, is amazing! Purchased for my mom in a memory care center. She doesn‚Äôt have to answer the phone, we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us. Picture clarity awesome! Staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently. Doesn‚Äôt replace room camera but good. Would give a 5 but can‚Äôt figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her. Anyone know? Great product. Absolute love it. Alexa is fun to converse with and has a wealth of information I love that you and now see your answer on a screen with the Alexa Echo Show!!! It was a bit more involved getting set up but thereafter the function is simply talking to Alexia. The plug adapter to turn on and off lights TV is useful and certainly worth having. Adds some nice tricks to the regular Echo lineup. Video calls to other Show owners works well. Speakers sound good. THE ECHO SHOW WORKS WELL, BUT AT THIS TIME IT CANNOT CONNECT TO YOUTUBE. MAYBE WHEN AMAZON WAKES UP THE CONNECTION WILL BE RETURNED. It\\'s a lot of fun. To fully enjoy it, we had to get Amazon music unlimited. We bought four of them, so we can keep in touch with family. Alexa is very entertaining! I seen one that my son-in-law had and enjoyed using it. I love how I can see my grandkids. I also bought my kids one so they can just \"Drop In\" and I can see them. It also shows words to some songs to sing along. It is fun to have!! The best product I have used for AI. Easy set up and easy to use. If you‚Äôre lik me and trying to update your home into a smart home, this is a must need. I have by my bed side and am able to see the front door he echo show is great. I can use it to monitor my outside inside cameras. Alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated It has been wonderful. I bought it for my boyfriend but I get more use out of it then he does The Amazon Show is a great addition to the Smart Home, easy to set up and to link up with a hub. The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However, the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But, who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues. All in all I am getting used to the features and like it. This is the best assistant from Amazon, with the completion of the screen you can also see images from cameras and other devices!Simply awesome! I am satisfied with this purchase, I can see my family now without doing tango, Skype & etc.. We can have different phones from iOS and android to see each other and it‚Äôs very clear thanks Amazon...... The echo show works very well with Bluetooth and WiFi. Great sound and screen. Recommend to anyone Works great! Now if my dogs would actually answer when I call it would be even better! They‚Äôre just not interested but at least I can see what they‚Äôre doing i love the addition of my echo show to my other Alexa devices. Having the screen to read recipes and viiew notes is great! If you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather, markets, and the latest news the Amazon Echo Show is what you are looking for. Honestly, the product is top of the line technology, and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it, and read the directions. The size of it is truly perfect; it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand, and with that it truly can serve that purpose. It also has a touch screen, and I feel it is very durable and can stand to last. The sound quality is also superb, with dual 2-inch speakers. It has Bluetooth capabilities as well, but it only works with android, Samsung, Fire OS, IOS device, excluding Mac products. The Echo Show comes in two colors black and white. The product has many different features and functions, and they can accommodate pretty much anyone‚Äôs needs. The top feature is the Alexa App, which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything. Then I believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want. Also you can tell it to volume up or down as well. Another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command Smart Home options. A couple things that could be improved, is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words, and it will search for something you aren‚Äôt expecting. The other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices, so then you don‚Äôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly. The price is also fair as well, for its creative capabilities it has. So if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the Echo Show would be a great addition for you. Love the echo show so much! Easy to use, connects to your mobil phone to easily call people! 9.5/10 Rating ! This has to be one of the best AI products I have used in a while. The screen for an smart home device can be very useful. It really can\\'t compete with the Google home because the Show just brings convenience without having to call it. I primarily use the show to turn on/off my smart lights, simple cooking measurements, simple math, travel time, store location hours, calling, and video calling.... and more. Everything else like, news, calendars, weather are already displayed on screen. Definitely worth it if you plan on using all the minimum features above. Love the many features ! Highly recommend it! using the echo saves me lots of unnecessary work... and that‚Äôs amazing! Used in my home office, gives me all of the information I ask for while my computers are doing other chores. Plays any music that I request, decent quality sound. I like my Show, but i can\\'t say i love it, for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices, it has probably the worst microphone. Getting it to respond is frustrating at times, where i have no problem with a standard echo. besides this, it all works as advertised. I\\'d wait for the second generation, i\\'m sure they can work the kinks out. I bought this as a gift. As far as know it works fine Great sound and amazing options. Love this!!! Great replacement for original echo I bought this as a gift so I haven\\'t gotten to use it much yet. The initial setup was really easy and I am sure that she is going to love it! Facilitates easy home set-up of many Smart devices. Having 3 amazon echos I had to pick up these to add to more rooms. These work best in the bedroom or kitchen. Video display is bright. Video calling is a great addition and is flawlessly, get them when they go on sale I have multiple echos and dots but this one is way better. Who doesn‚Äôt like seeing the lyrics of the music, or using video chat with other echo shows. I have two and thinking of getting another one soon. User friendly, hand free little assistant. Makes your mornings easier and gets you started for the day. And it looks cool I bought this for my sister for Christmas. She loved them! I love it.. easy to use. Many different features... The Echo Show is a very awesome product because of Alexa itself! She will answer questions you ask her, play music on your demand, and you can even ask her to make calls and video chats for you. I also like the fact that it sounds very nice and the video quality is unlike anything I\\'ve ever seen in a hybrid tablet product. A must have for your home! it works well and sounds very good and the pictures are good too Bought the Echo Show because of the display and am not disappointed. The Echo was purchased for somebody as a gift but this was purchased for me and is working great. The only thing that I am disappointed with is that I have to go through Bluetooth to play my music which is on iTunes. The display is also very vivid and clear. Purchased this device at launch (2 pack for $384.xx) and now YouTube doesn\\'t work. YouTube was one of the main features that I used. Without YouTube you\\'ll be better off buying the $40 Echo Dot instead. I‚Äôm in love with Alexa. Love her fir music, quick weather updates and in the kitchen for recipes. It‚Äôs great getting them step by step and not having to keep putting the passcode in on my iPad with hands covered in flour. Amazon\\'s Echo Show has been a great help to my daily rutine. From asking simple things like the weather to more specific things like flash briefings or traffic to my commute, echo show is a great tool for any tech enthusiast my children loving alexa always talking to alexa every day hehehe Alexa is a great product that can perform tasks and answer all kinds of questions. The Show and its video feature makes it that much more interactive. I use it in my office as a personal assistant. Not just for the home Alexa controls my lights, TV and sound system. Very happy with this. We bought two of these for the kids. They love them and I now have an echo dot Love the Amazon Echo Show! The video display is so helpful. Very good quality video and audio sounds better than the Echo Plus speaker. Search a recipe and use it without flipping through recipe books. Need to know a measurement conversion? Just ask Alexa! Learn cooking techniques, recommended cooking times...endless list of available answers. Great addition to my kitchen. LOVE that we can play Christmas music throughout our home using all our Echo devices. Lots of fun. This works just like all echo products,,,.with smart accessories you can control your home thermostat, lights etc. Alot of expandable options. Love my new I Pad, and New TV for my kitchenAlso bought 3 Alexa with pods for my family at xmas Just an average Alexa option. Does show a few things on screen but still limited. I got this as a spur of the moment thing. I figured it was going to be super gimmicky but was pleasantly surprised that it\\'s actually a very helpful device for organizing, shopping, smart home control, listening to music, or even watching some videos while I\\'m washing dishes. My show is in my kitchen and I\\'ve used it for countless things. I think this is amazon\\'s best Alexa yet. Gave it to my husband for his birthday and he loves it! He is able to change the screen picture from his phone so there are different pictures everyday. Nice to tell Alexa to keep track of what we need at the store. Can‚Äôt wait to use it more! I love the ECHO- Alexa is awesome... it was a Christmas present... Also received two Dots to place in other rooms.... Bought this to start implementing smart home features. Gets the job done and the screen is a nice addition. If you keep asking it to do things, you will be surprised at how much it can do Bought this for a Christmas gift, so haven\\'t actually seen this in action yet. Checked other reviews and they were good, and Best Buy had an awesome Black Friday price. The show is an all in one Alexa-enabled machine. I love the words to the songs and I\\'m all about being able to watch my amazon prime videos. Fun and easy to use. Music sounds great. Set timers, reminders and sync your calendar. I\\'m giving one as a gift to my daughter so we can video chat with \"drop in\" any time. Plug n play, easy to use. Speakers are good for music. I love this thing! It‚Äôs so fun and easy to use. My 3 year old even uses it to play the trolls or lion king soundtrack The Echo Show is a great addition to the Amazon family. Works just like the Echo, but with a 7\" screen. Bright vibrant display. Rich clear sound. Works great with Arlo security cameras. Excellent smart home addition. Just hope Google and Amazon start playing nice with each other soon so youtube will work again. purchased for a capstone team to test and review how it would benefit today\\'s journalist. This product is super easy to use and the sound quality is terrific. I use it every day! The easy of use is also appreciated! Fairly easy to use on set up and use. Most annoying issue is when the kids try to talk to her. Mainly use for music and general information. I do like the Alexa stuff and how it can connect to my phone. Plan on getting the door bell video stuff next. Amazon ECHO show is excellent with add-on video features. The screen is smaller than I expected but meet the requirements. 4 stars only because its s e is bing. works great with arlo cameras Display is great for doing video calls with others with echo show. Works well with home automation devices. Sound is great for listening to music. I bought the Alexa Show on a whim, and it was a great decision. My wife and daughter absolutely love it, and they ask Alexa questions and to play their favorite music all the time. The display is very nice, and I love the sleek look of it. Amazon has outdone itself. My daughter bought a show so my 10 year old grandson could get in touch with her when he got home from school so I bought one so he could call us and we can see each other. We love it. Great addition to the amazon device family. Great Christmas gift. We purchased the Amazon - Echo Show with Alexa in store. Took it home and after connection wi-fi it was great. we cannot wait to buy light bulbs and a thermostat. Great buy I wasn\\'t sure what to expect from my echo show, but I am super happy that I bought it. Alexa is great. She tells me the weather, traffic, news updates and more each day. Great for looking up recipes when your cooking and your hands are tied up. Also, perfect for ‚Äúdropping in‚Äù on family & friends. I already have 6 Amazon devices (2 Echo\\'s and 4 Dot\\'s). I expected this device to be slightly different as it is the only Amazon device I have with a screen. I was pleasantly surprised at the large number of helpful features that a screen could bring. It occasionally scrolls suggestions across the screen, and most of them have been very helpful. I\\'m planning on setting another one up at my 93 year old mothers house. She\\'ll get a kick out of it also. Bought 3 of these for Christmas for my Family members.I‚Äôve had mine for a year in my Kitchen and just love it!So much you can do with it and works great with my 5 Arlo Pro cameras.Big plus...Amazon is Always updating the Show to do more. Despite a less than friendly price point (if you don\\'t get it on sale), this Amazon item is well designed and delivers on the promises in the hype and product description. The emphasis with this item is \"show\", so it\\'s no surprise that sound quality does not compare with the Echo, but if you want the convenience of a voice controlled screen other than your phone, this product delivers. It\\'s value is even greater when paired with other smart devices such as security cams. Another added bonus comes when friends or family also have a Show, so that you can do \"drop in\", which is essentially visual phone calls. It\\'s great for checking on elderly family because it does not require them to be technically savvy. Previously had 2 echo Dots in play at my home, so knew I wanted more from my Alexa. Echo show now in kitchen and allows easy review of youtube for entertainment and recipe instructions. Also like streaming music and having the lyrics stream, too!!! Very cool. Looking forward to Alexa learning more and more to respond to my questions on various topics. Hands free is the way to go. The Alexa Show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the Show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that I had in the older device. I\\'m not sure if I\\'m missing it in the Show but I was able to get internet cameras on the older device (such as San Diego Zoo Elephants) that you can\\'t get on the Show. While certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch. Setup was pretty straight forward and easy. It is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent. It is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want. (such as \"play\" or \"start\" or \"open\") I use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then 4 more or other combination. You would have to set up several different alarms, one for each day as far as I can see. Some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming, I don\\'t really want to be terrified awake each day. I found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well. It would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you\\'d like. I don\\'t see that yet anywhere. Another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off. If you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times I\\'d rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe, which is possible, but very sensitive and if you miss, here comes snooze! Just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly. I am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so I can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time. Hoping that works well when it arrives.It will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed. All in all I\\'d say it\\'s a good emerging technology but needs a little work. Considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago It\\'s kind of where we\\'re heading. Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own \\'surveillance system\\' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren\\'t quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it\\'s close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device! I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :) No real upgrades to the iPhone 7 from the 6. There is no learning curve for sure. However the camera is better and that is a plus. We have greatly enjoyed using Alexa and having this gadget in our kitchen. I love the echo show. It is a personal assistant, DJ, weatherman & news person all in one. This is our second Show. We love the video qualties & the sound can\\'t be beat. My entire family enjoyed all of the purchases we from the store Wife wanted this gift and it did not disappoint, it\\'s the next step in Amazon\\'s capabilities, adding visual to the sound that was already there. I had an Alexa, but thought the show would be cool as it would allow me to link a camera to it, see videos for info I wanted to look up, play my prime video account. It would have been a 5 if I could see all prime shows/movies on it. The echo show works great for home automation. Being able to see your security cameras or drop in on your home through the echos camera are great features. Its great, just needs expanding information on it. We had the Echo (still do, it\\'s just in another room) and purchased the Show. We also have a couple of Dots and have them all set to communicate with each other. As you walk by the Show, it gives mini tips, news, fun facts, etc. Love it! You can even use it like Skype with others who have a show. My wife wanted this, so I got it as a gift. Even though I have had an Amazon Echo for a year, I think the Show is much better. The screen takes a lot of the mystery out of what Alexa is doing. Both my wife and daughter love it. This thing is awesome, great speakers on it too. Go out and grab one Our 5th Echo Show. We love the Drop In feature, allowing us to use them as an intercom. The ease of playing music on all of them at once throughout the house, and controlled from any device is used daily. The connection to our Sonos system is a real plus. Also connected to our Dish TV receiver. I love the Echo Show and its many features, great purchase. I use to communicate with family. I love the drop in feature and it‚Äôs much easier to hear everyone as opposed to FaceTime on speakerphone. It has more to offer, but that is enough for me to recommend for anyone who uses video to keep in touch. Was recommended to me, and we love it, use for music, timer in the kitchen, great recipes, and love the question of the day, only have had for 2 weeks can‚Äôt wait to explore more! Bought for my daughters dorm, good device for streaming, making calls, etc., even for quick weather report Love it so much! Have been using it every day...news, YouTube videos... buying more smart home products to make good use of Alexa. I love this unit. Very well designed and built. It\\'s very easy to use and has a huge amount of features. The screen is beautiful, but the audio could use a bit more bass IMHO. I bought 3 for Christmas gifts. The screen really does add tremendous value. The bugs are almost all worked out and the quality of hearing my commands is night and day from a month ago. We really enjoy the Echo Show! I have the Echo in the living room & the Echo Show in the bedroom. It‚Äôs great to have the visual of all the requests for Alexa Love it, bought one for everyone in the family.. I know they‚Äôll love it too Purchased for my 87 year old mother as a safety/convenience, entertainment device. She loves it! finds it easy to use, loves to have music throughout the house. Amazon has made another great product! The ‚Äúshow‚Äù goes perfectly in the kitchen! Recipes, music,weather! All done hands free!! Fast set up! I bought these as a gift for my adult kids to video chat while in college. The second best feature was YouTube. Amazon just sell google home and chromcast for goodness sakes! Another great echo product... really cool feature is the lyrics scrolling across the screen when playing music! It works fast and very clear, speakers sound amazing, looks great in bedroom. I have several versions of Amazon\\'s Echos - the original, and Echo Plus, 2 Taps and 2 Dots. The Show is the best sounding of the bunch and you have the screen as a bonus. I added a battery pack to make it portable and it\\'s perfect for us. I love it. It does so much and is so easy to use. I use it mostly for music and questions. I love the Echo show. I have found so many uses such as weather updates, recipes and random questions. My grandkids love it for stories, songs, pictures and just being plain silly. I don\\'t think I\\'ve tapped into its full potential yet. I don\\'t think a person can go wrong with this purchase. Fun and useful, very interactive and still learning all abilities. It‚Äôs great I use it a lot and yes I will tell friends and family about it I really like it it‚Äôs user-friendly and I was by 55 Coolidge from Apple family to the family It has been a lot of fun using in our kitchen. I think we use it much more than we thought we would. Alexa reminds me of all my appointments and it‚Äôs a great tool Nice way to see the internet and also to view security cameras. Very handy device. Easy to log in and set up. Good sound. Needs a remote for the volume as is changes with each radio station, song, or replies. alexa is awesome and screen makes her even better can\\'t wait to get another Thanks for the display version of Alexa - I love this model. This is a must have is great for recepies, while you are cooking Alexa gives you the info. For the ines that are used to a tablet or iPod that you have to stop and read this is awesome plus. So much easier to follow things. Love Alexa and everything she can do! So great you can connect to other devices. I bought the echo show for my mom for her birthday and she loves it! We use it all the time. I have a lot of Echos devices. Each room in my house has some kind of smart speaker (I have also Google Home devices).The Echo Show is the best device to use in a living room or kitchen. The screen is bright and sharp, and it\\'s a nice feature to follow recipes, watch videos or even listen to music once the lyrics are displayed on the screen.It\\'s also the best way to see calendar entries, to do and shopping lists. I love the show. It was so easy to set up. I use it every day for music and weather info. Can\\'y wait to see how it works for Christmas cookies. I am just learning what the Amazon Echo Show will do. I\\'ve used it as a timer, I\\'ve listened to Iheart radio, I love the smart lights that I bought at the same time. Alexa turns them on/off when I tell her to. When the holiday rush is over, I will go online to learn many more things. This thing is really cool, love that it gives all the words to songs I‚Äôm an amazon prime member and the show is awsum I use it to communicate with the son who lives in Seattle. You can watch amazon pirime tv,play amazon music. Text, play games read the lyrics while the song is playing. I love it One of my favorite gadgets. It can do so .any things. Easy set up, simple to use, and lots of fun! Alexa can tell you the weather forecast, play any music you‚Äôd like to hear, read you recipes and so much more! Great product Not a very responsive program. Very limited information program. Not user friendly. Best item I ever use. I would love to get another one. Alexa does a lot of fun things but you must enable various apps. She gives funny answers to funny question. However, she is not a complete internet surfer, many things she has no answer. I bought it for my son in laws birthday after they bought me one for Christmas. Not just good for music but helpful for grandkids homework and now we can video chat with grandkids, which the one year old loves! Using it in my kitchen. The whole family has access and we can all use different functionality. Great for looking up recipies, music and calling relatives or friends I got this to work with my Arlo Pro camera, and it works well. I am able to have my camera for driveway and front door come up on command. I hate that I cannot get my Samsung TV to come on with a verbal request. I guess I will have to buy the plug for it. This was very easy to set up. Downloaded the app, and plugged it in, viola it walks you through the setup. I waited a couple months to review giving Amazon time to make this product equal to the SONY Dash from nearly a decade ago, it isn\\'t the screen provides nothing of value and you can\\'t turn of amazon tips! you have near zero customization can\\'t even move the clock to the other side of the screen. And something that a sony dash did nearly 10 years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm! seriously this is the biggest fail! Run away from this half baked Amazon disaster! Im impressed with it. I can monitory my Arlo cameras at when ever i want and I can treat my Sirius radio Very easy to use and good quality, nice picture and good size for a desk This Alexa device is great fun, and useful for several personal assistant type applications. I use it in conjunction with some TP-Link Light switches, and it works flawlessly. It is nice to see the lyrics to songs she plays, and calling other people who have the show or spot works well. She is also really good at setting reminders and alarms. Another useful feature is as an in home intercom. I Love this I don\\'t even have to turn on my tv I just talk to Alex a and she does what I tell her. Great help from assistants in the store. They were very knowledgeable and took the time to help me choose the right product for my needs. It\\'s nice to see my calendar and the sound is good too. Its a great product, but for the cost, the speakers are not what they should be, and the screen is too small. Choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out. Hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem, and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls. Voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot. I am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance. Easy setup for connections to wi-fi cameras, Amazon Digital Subscriptions and coming soon....YouTube. Add your videos and BOOM...to the screen they come. Good for Amazon music and news. Brilliant for controlling lights in the house. I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show, they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn\\'t totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that\\'s a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it\\'s shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system, robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful, fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home. This is an awesome device, but it isn\\'t life changing. It is basically the same as the Echo. I don\\'t use the video much. Amazing how much stuff this can do everything from a alarm clock to listening to music,asking questions and controlling devices .the sound front the speakers is really great. Love this product easy to use and it does so much ch purchased the show after I picked up the ECHO PLUS, 2 DOT\\'S & a TAP! This smart home system is addictive and I will be adding more soon! Does what it is advertise for and more. Had fun setting it up and amazed on what it can do. I even use it for security. Love the ability to video chat with grand kids, Enjoying the music everyday. Its an awesome item. Me and the kids love it. Great product. Use it in the kitchen and can see who is at the front door with it being connected to my ring doorbell. Recently divorced I bought 2 of these tonserve as homebase for me and my 8 year old. It has helped him to know there is one spot in both our houses he can reach me by simply saying drop on daddy My wife purchased this for me at Christmas. Was very surprised because she said she did not want a device like this in the house. I think she is enjoying it more than me. Easy to link with nest thermostat and smart plugs. Even figured out how to operate older garage door with it. If I can only figure a way for it to bring me a beer now. We really are enjoying asking Alexa questions and she is connected to our Sonos system playing music around the house. She doesn‚Äôt always understand me. Not sure if it is her or me. I loved this thing until it was time to go to bed. Although it dims, the lowest setting is still very bright--like sleeping with a flashlight in your face. I hope they make fixes that will allow the screen to dim more. Also, not crazy about having a camera connected to the Internet on my nightstand. If you cover it up, the motion sensor then won\\'t work. The sound is OK--not quite as good as the non-screen Echo--maybe because it\\'s not omni-directional like the regular Echo. My enthusiasm for this device has subsided quite a bit because of these issues. Got one for my mom in order to video chat with her. Works awesome. Such an easy set up. My family and I use it for so many things. Wake up in the morning, the morning commute traffic report. Recipes, facts, phone calls and of course music! Since I got it and have had friends and family over, they have gone out to buy it as well. Excellent purchase. Well worth the money! Second purchase of Echo Show. Love the device and all of it\\'s features. Used primarily for communication with my 90 yo mother. I drop in, there\\'s nothing for her to do but talk and smile :) I use the Alexa app on my phone with mom (which works very well and still use when mobile) but I got this one for ease at home. Amazing. I seriously didn\\'t know what I was missing until I got the Amazon Show. While I have Alex Echo (and love this), having a screen that can connect to other smart home devices is amazing. I love the jokes, random questions I can ask or telling me the weather. Its essential in our house now. The best part about the echo is that you can actually use it to watch videos, the security cameras connected to your house, listen to music and watch the baby sleep. I love my Echo Show. Already had 2 and when these when BB had a BIG sale price, I couldn\\'t order it fast enough! I can see my Nest cameras (another 5 * product), make video calls to other Show owners, voice calls to anyone else (except 911) and a whole host of skills that are being added almost daily. My only regret is not replacing my 2 remaining Echo Dots when they were on sale. I won\\'t make that mistake on next big sale.I also received 2 of the \\'other\\' home assistants included as free bonuses for buying a couple of other things. I thought that it was only fair to compare the two, disregarging the video aspects of Show. Amazon\\'s Shows and Dots. Echos were like comparing Lambourgini to a \\'68 VW Bug. Setting up these things are like the expression I heard as a kid, \"Easier than fallin\\' of a log and not near as dangerous.\" I purchased this for my husbandHe had been waiting for it for a long timeHe owns Alexa and loved iti do too The Echo Show device connects with a range of services, including Amazon Music to expand your experience. Ask questions and see the answers with the Echo Show, which connects to Alexa for an immersive search experience. Love Alexa especially the touch screen - can play games- like Jeopardy I love the Alexa system of assistance. This version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won‚Äôt get to have to the option to pick up. You need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private. I installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use. The echo show does so much,the music line up is good,it can do anything. This was bought for a gift. But it looks nice. Just what was expected Excellent addition to our Amazon components. It is especially better than other versions at hearing varying voices and responding to commands. A great new Amazon device to add to my other Alexa products. The visuals are amazing, and it is so easy to use and set up. Lot to learn, but great device. Connecting to other devices can be frustrating, but over time should be better. Connect to my Bose blue tooth speaker, then tried the dot. Seems connection can be to only one device at a time. Still checking help app but limited info. I love it, it works great, I love the drop in func. I love having this in my kitchen, it has replaced my ipad that i used to use. I love to use Alexa to listen to music, set timer,alarms,and ect. My parents use the show to show the cameras and stuff for a second control panel to their security system. Was debating on the purchase but looked very cool ,good quality video chat is clear I got two of these, super easy to set up. Only used them one day so far.Can\\'t fine one thing I don\\'t like about them. I am loving my Amazon Echo Show. It makes life easier! I love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking Alexa. I also love being able to video call friends and family that have an Echo Show or the Alexa App. Overall it is a great product! Love the Alexa A.I. Better than apple and google versions. The screen gives even more points because you can see all of Alexa‚Äôs responses as well as video call. Awesome Works great with my Ring doorbell and Ring security cameras. Love that I can see live feeds on my Echo show $150 is a good price for this Alexa with a screen. Great accessory for Alexis system..helpful and fun The amazon Show has to be one of the best smart home devices that every came out. Alexa, Videos, music, and drop in. Amazing product!!! Requires too many components. Cameras, etc. stick with basics (in my opinion). Very easy to set up and use. Really like the screen to view the items searched for, and to read information about the searched item. It does everything amazon, and I can even see who is at the front door with Arlo! It doesn\\'t do Netflix, or Hulu, but that\\'s okay. I really like the sound, it fills small rooms. It\\'s easy now to video chat with Nana, or drop in to tell my kid\\'s goodnight, when I am working late. This really is a great product, it has performed as expected so far A great new Amazon device to add to my other Alexa products. The visuals are amazing, and it is so easy to use and set up. I love my amazon show it‚Äôs a recommended product if you wanna have this item. However the down sides are it has a great speaker so if it‚Äôs full max it may be hard for Alexa to hear you. Another downside google hates amazon = not YouTube. I bought this device for my girlfriend to use in the kitchen so she could look up and see recipes and instructions when trying new food dishes. The device is great for this. We also love being able to listen to music, world news, search for items or products and easily order items from this device. We also are able to connect other devices and operate lights in the home. It does so much more. I think this is a great device for the home. Great electronic , very easy to install me and my family enjoy the things that Alexa do very satisfied with my service that I received from Best Buy when I purchase it looking forward to shopping there more often and I\\'m a new customer there Such a cool product. We primarily use it for music‚Äî definitely rivals brand name speakers, but can be used for so much more This is great. The entire family is using it. Son‚Äôs are using it for it music, husband for appointments, me for just about everything. It‚Äôs useful and fun. Great product will recommend it to friends and family. What a neat gadget. I thought I loved my echo dot n this is so much more. I like that u can video chat with other people who own it also. The kids love it Bought this for my better half and she loves it. It works very well with echo and has unlimited features. I was hesitant on purchasing this new echo but I\\'m glad I did. I really like having the feedback on the screen and seeing results in addition to the voice. Using it for weather, recipes and anything that can be displayed is a big help. The echo show responds fairly fast and looks great in my kitchen counter. A definite winner on this one. It did exactly what it\\'s suppose to and I\\'m still learning new features a month after having it! Very good decice If you use the Alexa ecosystem then the show is a must. This is my third echo, and the video screen is a nice addition. I\\'d like to give it 4.5 stars, but not an option. The only thing that\\'s is not as good as my previous ones is that I feel the microphone does not understand me as well. Also, at this point the screen has a lot of potential but not much is implemented yet. (e.g. watch cable tv over internet). As good as echo, with added visuals can be usefulAnd fun I use it for everything.... Mainly as my new alarm clock. cant wait for them to open it up even more. Recently upgraded from Alexa 1st generation. Really like the video screen and how much more it can do I love it I can call and do video camaras hear music My Echo Show is my Christmas gift to myself! So far I am having great fun with this nifty new addition to my Amazon family of home monitoring devices. I have connected the Show to my Ring doorbell. We put in the kitchen for the holidays and used a lot of new recipes Alexa found for us I like how it has the screen but I do like the echo plus better. Both gets the job done Got for my parents as a gift. Simple to use and they like it. Got on sale so was good value. I use it alot to play music instead of running the tv for my dog when we go somewhere. I use it for a lot of things. Bought my 5 daughters each one for Christmas & one for myself .. love the concept Great video quality, sound/music from a rather small device. Seems well made, entertaining, and more functional as we learn its many features. Bought for my parents, they love it. Easy to use and setup Haven‚Äôt set it up yet but really looking forward to using it. I have a regular Alexa and love that ,so This should be even better! Echo show has proven to be a handy gadget... useful for lots of things, like checking weather and just about any info on the web...also has great interfacing with other smart tech, like arlo cameras, ring doorbells, fire tv, etc. the more I use it the more I find it is useful, and the more I like it not a real fan of AI, but Alexa has become quite handy, entertaining, and informative. The Show itself, allows us to contact family that is in Florida and teleconference with them, in 1 simple step.Shows family photos stored in Amazon account.One word, simply AMAZING!!!Bought 1 for my parents, and they USE it!!! I bought this as a gift. They love it! It is really helpful to have around the house. Great product. with alexa in control you may need extra time to jog Added screen a great features visual effect a plus Love it. Simple setup. Ease of use. Very intuitive and fun. Awesome product. DoEs what it says and looks great Purchased for my husband but this is more a gift for the entire family. Luv the display. This product is great. I wish there was a way to play music from my phone other than Bluetooth only. She is not a technical person but enjoys the screen feature and uses it for cooking recipes. It\\'s not open yet it\\'s a bday gift. But I think they will love it Amazon Echo products are terrific and and quite helpful. Imagine taking the Alexa voice and adding some video to it. Really cool. Great for the kitchen where you can use it for recipes as well as music and other things. Love it. Does everything I want it to do and more. i loved this product so much i have bought four of them for christmas gifts Long time Alexa user. The video screen just takes it to the next level great product I loved the Amazon Echo, but to be able to see so much more on the screen is amazing! I highly recommend. I bought this as a gift for a relative with Amazon Echo in his house. He loves it. Great and easy to set up. We have this in the hallway and the whole family uses it. Alexa is learning what our family likes each day. My 8 yr old daughter uses it all the time as well. I like the display with news. Found out a command to turn off screen which was bright at night. I haven\\'t used for movies etc. but that should be fairly simple. Sound is decent and picture quality is not bad too. I bought with $100 discount on two. This product worked very well and very easy to use. This amazon echo is awesome, my girl loves it, im happy The three star review is for the situation described here, not the quality of the unit. I ordered this online and picked it up in store. The package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory. The Echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package. When I hooked it up, however, it said that the unit was registered to someone else. It wasn\\'t a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine. I spoke to both Amazon and Target about this, and neither could tell me what happened. I was offered an exchange if I wished. I chose to keep the original unit, but I wanted to make others aware of the issue. I have one theory. Target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for Target resale, and they are all registered to this person. I guess I\\'ll never know. The Echo itself works fine and I\\'m very happy with it. After you hook it up, make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates. Then you should be good to go. Love that I can view my arlo cams on it , love it plays movie trailers on point , love the lyrics when playing music , love the video calls, love the drop in to other Alexa devices around the house (they now work as intercoms) so I can be in the 3rd floor of my house (3 story home in Las Vegas ) the doorbell rings I can say alexa show me front door (arlo cam) then I can say alexa open front door, drop in on the echo by front door and say come on up , Just having a blast with this stuff , yes I am in deep with the smart home thing.. alexa turn on the lights (hue color lights) , turn on the fan (wemo switches) Alexa set house to 77 degrees (nest ) so endless , yeah I would say the ECHO SHOW IS A GOOD START ... I use this thing every night to fall asleep. Although Alexa don‚Äôt always understand me I still love the device. Finally decided to try Alexa. Lights, heating, doors, etc... everything is homekit compatible in my house. But this one was too tempting! What a great device. Alexa is years ahead of Siri, great system to have by your bed, and it also controls most of my devices... Love this product, able to read recipes instead of just hearing them. Speaker is pretty good too. The device works well mechanically, however, the software needs a lot of work. Half of my commands are not understood and I have cameras linked up to it that‚Äôs rarely recognized. she loves it, got it for her for xmas, we all love to play with it. Love the new video version ! Easy to setup and great to use! Echo show is a great product.Good with my security cameras and playing music.Youtube would be great. If you use an Echo, you will love the Echo Show. Bought this one for a relative after they experienced mine. Great product and it is very easy to set up and use Echo show easy to set up. Wish it included the swivel base that is a option now. Love the added video! Plays any music you request, answers questions, even tells jokes to my 10 yr old. Much more capability than we\\'ve unleashed yet! Alexa with screen? LOVE it! Works perfectly with my Ring doorbell. We got this since we have the previous echo and love them. Easy to use and set up. Highly recommend! Its a lot more then we expected.this is a wonderful addition to our tech life I bought several Alexa‚Äôs for Christmas gifts also for myself also bought Amazon Show for Christmas gift also for a my youngest Daugter ! This does the same stuff as the traditional Echo or Echo Dot, except it has a screen. If you already liked the Echo\\'s this is a good addition. The addition of the screen is neat, but certainly not essential. You can see daily news headlines and the weather scroll across the screen. You can watch any Arlo or similar cameras on it. You can watch YouTube and Amazon Video as well, but you\\'ll probably just watch that on a phone, tablet or TV instead. I love the the ability to video chat and watch videos on how to do stuff Just love it. Some very innovative. Very user friendly This was a Black Friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and Alexa worked well with the Ring doorbell system. There are times when you have to ask her the same thing over and over until she figures it out but overall it was a food deal. Bought this for my mom. She thinks it\\'s great. It is easy to use and hooked right up to all her previously owned items. The video screen really adds wonderfully to the functionality of the echo devices. This amazon echo is most likely the best way to go! A great addition to our home. Kids love it and is vary helpful Got this for my mother who\\'s eye site has been failing to the point of not being able to dial the phone or write down appointments. She can now video chat with members of the family. Send emails, check her appointments, place phone calls just by requesting it. It has helped her so much. Nice device. Good to enable drop in conversations. Some flash briefings. But overall still a little limited in effective use of video My wife said I‚Äôm developing a ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù home...while I‚Äôm still learning what all I can do with this over the regular Echo, I am looking forward to getting my Ring Doorbell installed! Great product, I can rave enough about them!!! It‚Äôs good I don‚Äôt know what I am doing. Can u say you tube Purchased this item for our daughter. She absolutely loves it! I love the echo show! The only thing I dislike is it doesn\\'t play YouTube videos. Not a deal breaker though. a bit difficult to set up, but it is amazing. Love the screen! Bought the Echo Show to add on all my smart wifi appliances, wifi video doorbell, smart TV & sound bar, wifi smart lights, wifi smart thermostat, wifi security camera system and so on. Great overall, would be nice to have parental controls though. The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that‚Äôs compatible with my mother‚Äôs Arlo Security cameras. It works great! I bought 2 shows and I am loving them. Them video flash briefing are wonderful and personalized. I don\\'t have to keep my phone on me 24/7 to keep in touch with my closest family members; they can just drop in and I can do the same with the kids when away from the house. I made 2 more purchases immediately after to put them in my office and living room. I love the lyrics when music is playing and looking at the forecast on the fly. They are a must have for a modern home. Enjoying Alexa! There is so much you can ask her! Looking forward to the security monitoring . I love my Echo Show. It is easy to use and being an Amazon Prime member I can play all my songs. I cook dinner listening to music. I also linked my SiriusXM to it so i can listen to my favorite music. It is so easy to use my 80 year old mother wantwd one. Product works well and is fairly simple to operate The Echo show screen is great, it is helpful with recipes, music etc. I use it to listen to music all the time. I am hoping someone in my family gets one soon so we can face time each other. Like the fact that I can see videos and utilize ir with my lighting system. I bought this for my elderly parents that refuse to get a smart phone.They loved it, and feel safer with it. I programmed it to call 911 if they fall and need help. Plus they can see the grand children without any confusion. Video integration it\\'s big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check who\\'s at the door when doorbell rings. qc is really bad on this product and does not catch the voice properly. I didn\\'t expect this device to be so diverse unexpected surprise THIS IS AWESOME WE LOVE IT SO MUCH TALK & C PEEPS!!! It was a cool device but my main issue that it couldn‚Äôt play playlists the I had stored on the sonos app. It only played streaming services Love this thing. Little apprehensive at first. But Alexa will grow on you We love our echo show, It‚Äôs fun to use and she can do a lot of things. When I purchased this item, I was unaware how much it really does. I can literally control my entire home with it. Too many great things to say about the echo show! I have had an echo dot for a while but the new echo who adds video. I literally use it everyday multiple times a day. Great product Amazon! Great sound, easy set up. The screen seems sort of wasteful now that I\\'ve been playing with it. Maybe it has the capability to work as a digital picture frame....I\\'m just certain yet. I was able to set one picture to it...Not multiple. Would be nice if could be used for Hulu or Netflix and stuff since the picture and sound are so clear. I like the visual to do and shopping lists. Still worth the purchase. A good want to have...just not a must have...then again maybe I have not tapped into all it can do. Not only does it round out my collection of Alexa devices, I have two echos and one dot, it also works well with the Ring 2 Video Door Bell,I can see who is at my front door without opening it. It is amaizin I like the way you type and search my favorites Worthless, except as a regular echo and a poor excuse for video chat. I love my echo devices, bathroom, pool, kitchen, other places where I may need hands free, voice activated music and info. My wife bought me the \\'newest, hottest\\' thing. I was skeptical but then thought I would use it to help on a project. Me \"Alexa find videos on f450 drone\" Alexa \"YouTube is not available\". Amazon won\\'t directly sell chrome products, youtube won\\'t play on echo show. Further testing shows the video call is more limited than iPhone or Android apps for video. So the most useful thing now is the same voice functions that my echos and dots perform. Unless I want to make all of my video calls and check the weather from a device I can move no more than 3 feet from an outlet. It is a great product. It works great would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to buy one. Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it. Great device for me because I already owned bunch of stuff that supports Alexa. Needs more skills. And need YouTube to work! If you like video this goes along perfect ...a must buy Purchased the Echo Show for my wife and she loves it! Full of great information, weather and more. Can control lights and various things at the house. Even askes you the question of the day! Easy set up and to use. Mainly bought it to monitor the Arlo Pro 2 cameras we purchased. Only download was very slow and echo show didn‚Äôt make it worth having as a stand alone Great device. Love Alexa being able to pull up home cameras to view!! I feel the audio on the show is the best when compared to the echo, echo 2.0, and obviously dot. Nice to have next to bed instead of a dot and an alarm clock This amazon echo show is great for room monitoring. It was priced well and I find it useful. We are new to connected home equipment. I got this for my wife in our kitchen. The only thing I wish was different would be that the Amazon Show would communicate directly with FaceTime rather than having to have someone download the Alexa app. Not a deal breaker by any means though. We love it I love my new Alexa Show. Checked prices thoroughly and Best Buy was was the ‚Äúbest‚Äù and 5 minutes away. Product is great. Easy setup and works as stated. Staff very helpful. Would recommend this product and definitely this model. :) We purchased the Echo Show for Christmas this year, and love it so much! Our kids got the hang of it faster than we did (ages 11 and 13)! Highly Recommend! We bought the Amazon Echo Show for my dad. We set up accounts for him to access music and pictures and wrote down a sample list of commands he could use. He loves it. Excellent product. No end to the features you can set up. This device is alot better than the small alexa. Did everything i wanted it to Great amazon device i love these have 2 in my house they are awesome A step up from last year\\'s Echo. Great addition to any part of the room. I bought this as a gift for my husband and he is constantly asking Alexa questions about everything. We love listening to music on it as well. Was so excited to get this!!! It is so much fun to use. Great product but the only downside is that it did NOT work with my home security camera Great sound and picture. Been using as a baby monitor. Still new to Alexa so still learning what she can do The Echo was so good, I ended up getting the Echo Show as well. At first it was a device that I enjoyed using for various reasons, one being that I could ask Alexa to watch any YouTube videos I wanted to watch. Then one day, I asked Alexa to play a video and she responded by saying,\"Google is not supported on Echo Show.\" Until YouTube comes back as a skill, the Echo Show probably isn\\'t worth the extra money. I\\'d say stick with the Echo if you have Amazon Music or Spotify, or the Echo Dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home. Having LOTS of fun with Alexa! Tells us weather, stories, plays music trivia games with us, helps with shopping list, and can face to face talk with my sister in another state (bought one for her too) - great addition to our home! Talk to it and see responses on the touch screen. Love it!! This is a great addition to the Echo family, bringing new and cool features. Great device for music and face time calls. The sound is crisp and clear. Many options with the Echo Show Easy to set up. But it does not work with all phones.. I have Samsung 4 Easy to set up and use. Useful and fun. The videos make things easy to understand. We bought 2 of them and love them. The screen is really clear and the sound is amazing. Go get one I love all of my Amazon echo devices. Right now it doesn\\'t allow YouTube, but hopefully they will reach an agreement and fix that. if nothing else I have peace of mind that should she fall or need assistance then I can now better assist My mother has dementia and this keeps her busy for periods of time. She is fun to have around. Just got this in the mail last night. Setting it up today and I want to love it. The kicker for me buying it was being able to connect our Arlo cameras and view instantly. The display in the store had great sound. love it and it only keeps getting better over time. Great product, i recommend is easy to use and fast. Nice way to see the internet and also to view security cameras. Very handy device. The Echo Show is a version of Alexa with ability to visualize things. When I was cooking dinner and wanted to finish a show, I was able to ask Alexa to play the show from my Amazon Prime account. The Show was in my kitchen, easy to view, and enabled my kids to watch cartoons in the living room. I love it! Everybody enjoys this product. We use it to show each other things from my home to my daughters in Melbourne, Florida, keep a running shopping list that can be seen just by asking, and for both verbal and visual reminders of events. I was unsure if this was worth it before I did. After buying and bringing it home I‚Äôm glad I did. I enjoy being able to video chat threw it! Bought second one for my mom and she loves it so much Bought for my 88 year old Mom, she loves it, help her with recipes and cooking. Enjoy being able to view my Ring doorbell camera in live time upstairs This echo is amazing and it doubles as a picture display. The Echo show with video screen is a nice upgrade to the other echo‚Äôs. News briefs with videos are nice. Very good sound quality for playing music. I saw there was a new Echo with a screen and had to have it. I use it for Amazon Prime videos, YouTube, music with lyrics, recipes, and viewing the nursery with Amazon Cloud cam. The speaker is louder than I thought. Good purchase but I‚Äôd like to see more features for the screen. This is the main reason why I went with Amazon\\'s Echo ecosystem vs Google Home. I bought one as a gift to my sister so I can easily videochat with my family. My niece and nephew tend to fight over the Echo Show when they want to sing along to their favorite songs with the lyrics on the screen. My only wish was that there was an HDMI out to connect it to a larger monitor. Huge missed opportunity in my opinion. I\\'m disappointed. Sometimes gives doesn\\'t understand Echo show not only plays your music it puts up the lyrics to read from I didn‚Äôt think I would like the Echo Show ‚Äîespecially at the $200+ price point, but I tried it and love it! If I could afford it, and if they would add an audio port, I would replace my current Alexas with Echo Shows. The Echo Show is a great improvement from the original Echo device. It\\'s great being able to \"see\" what is going on!! The Echo Dot is a great personal assistant, and right now the price is fantastic. It can give you the weather forecast, traffic reports, daily news brief, play music from Pandora or other steaming radio stations, and answer questions, all in a very small package.. . Bought as a gift for my wife, she loves it and the screen is very handy for recipes and such. This thing is cool, you can do a lot of neat things with the show, hope they add more functionality to Alexa though. We have echos throughout the whole house and have this in the kitchen. Controls lights , you can FaceTime , my wife uses it for recipes and it shows the videos of directions This item is a great addition to your smart home, but just as the first gen Siri it is not all there yet. The kinks still needs to be worked out. Alexa does not have answers to a lot of things or commands. There\\'s a long learning curve. Setting up with apps is a lot work. It\\'s fun if your large circle is willing to spend the money to get one each. Great landline replacement. We are enjoying our amazon echo show. Alexa is so amazing answering questions and a variety of music!!!! Great device to stay in touch with your family if you leave in another city or state! I love all my Alexa\\'s I have the Echo and now for Christmas I got the Echo show. Not I can see my recipes and also connect with my family. I have a couple of these echos, they are wonderful they do everything like turn my lights on or the TV, my granddaughter love asking it question Needs to be a stand alone device. I should have not required to use a tablet of Cell phone to make it work. Amazon needs to work on the technology on device. We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it! I really enjoy having another way to communicate with family and friends Awesome all around product - great picture and like the voice control. I knew this item would be great, but the Echo Show has exceeded my expectations. Alexa has changed my life. I now own 3 Alexas. O Great product with cool features! Easy to install! I love the way it looks and feels. I don\\'t know why I waited so long to bring Alexa into my home. It\\'s how I listen to my music now, dictate my shopping and to-do lists and get my morning weather report just to name a few. I highly recommend this item. The show works great with my other products. Love it I was hesitant, and I am now hooked. This is both fun and useful Not sure will be keeping this. Worried about hacks that allow active mic. Loving it the ability to call up and watch sesame street with my daughter its awesome Love our Echo show. A few enhancements we‚Äôd like to see in future such as ability to load multiple pictures instead of single photo. Can use Amazon photo but we do not prescribe. My whole family loves Alexa. We have the dots in all the bedrooms. I love the smart home features you can add. I love the music offered as a prime member. And when you‚Äôre bored at home she will play games with you or even read you a book Love the echo show. Nice to have a visual. Love the drop in feature! Can use many differents apps from the Echo Show. Awesome product! I got this for a really good price. I already had the Echo Dot that I was kind of unimpressed with. I love the echo show. There are so many more things to do and the sound quality is great. I‚Äôve been enjoying this item and getting information so fast. Best purchase I ever made. Easy to set up. Plus, the screen is very clear and easy to view. Not sure I would like this, however, words to songs..Great and ability to view my outdoor and Indoor cameras is a plus. Still learning to use. Family is having fun with Alexa. I do like the way it integrates with other devices around the home: Arlo, Nest... Life amped! The features of this device have added a new dimension to our everyday routines. Pertinent and usable information by just simply asking. Superb product. Alexa show is easy to navigate. It‚Äôs wonderful having so much information at your finger tips. I already the Echo Dot and saw Amazon advertising for the new show over the summer. Got it as a gift and personally I love it. The speakers and sound from it are great. Plays the lyrics for any songs you have going, so you can karaoke without sucking now. Also displays the time, since I got rid of cable and no longer have that it is nice to have a clock in the living room. Very easy to interact with! I really enjoy using Alexa even watch videos utube many things it\\'s worth buying My daughter can‚Äôt wait to get this set up in her room Great product that a whole family would enjoy. It‚Äôs a perfect addition to the household. Great sounds! Works great with Ring doorbell and nest cameras as well! :) We have all three Echo products in our house. Each with a different usage. Got the Show for my parents and sister as well to communicate as we all live in different places. More for my parents, its ease of use is ideal for them, no computer knowledge needed, speak and they can connect with us. Best New Adult Toy in years! Wish I had purchased one for my parents. LOVE IT!!!! I am so happy with this product. It is so helpful to use st any time of the day. I.can do things while I am lying in bed definitely recommend this product You will be amazed how this works for many questions you ask and Alexa has the answer. However do not expect her to know everything. You will be happy with this purchase. Amazing. Voice recognition great at long distances. Amazon music great! Cant say enough good! Video calls work great and the screen is super informative. Between this product and Siri, AlexaIs much more useful and reliable. It controls many things in my home and is very dependable. Only one problem... commercials activate Alexa when it hears them. I didn\\'t think I needed Alexa to have a screen, but now I\\'m so glad we got this. When I ask to see my grocery list, it pops up on the screen. Also can do video calls from it. Really like our Alexa and the dots...we have them in almost every room of the house now. Wish the angle was adjustable. When this is sitting on a table or counter it is angled up and the further away from it you sit, the less likely it will see you in its view when trying to call someone. Love the Sirus XM update to play through this though. The speaker seems louder and better than the regular Echo, but that is just my thought. If you were able to get two for price of one, this is a deal worth taking. We use it to talk to our granddaughter, play games, listen to music and check on the dog while we are at work! Awesome device! We already bought one for our kids also! First bought the Dot to see if we liked it. We enjoyed it, but wanted a little more volume. When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice. Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room. For larger rooms the Show is a great choice. I got it for me and my brother for Christmas. Great gift. Great price. Very functional. Love device wrong color. Overall great device for Family. The echo show is great, works awesome together with my wink hub I can controle my whole house, another cool feature is I can sync my google calender to it and it shows my. upcoming events on the screen. Highly recommend the echo. I was against getting something in my house like this being skeptical about hackers watching thru the device. However, this is the greatest thing since sliced bread! It can do just about everything! And the sound is fantastic when steaming music! Being able to change the dish network channel by saying it is so convenient while hands are in the flour (for ex.)! Access to information is endless and immediate with her replies! We love it! The show is our new best friend. We watch shows on it everyday at lunch time. And we end every night saying ‚ÄúAlexa, turn off screen‚Äù this is pretty cool, we love ours, we listen to music and the sound is great, my kids are always asking her questions, we can call on it, set reminers, timers and alarms for us it was worth the price but one thing I dont like is that it nickles and dimes you, like even though I have a prime membership, all music is not available , I had to pay to upgrade to be able to listen to everything and it doesnt stop there, even though I upgraded it ,if you purchased the dots not everyone can play music at the same time, to do that youll have to pay to upgrade again. but even so I dont regret this purchase and the whole family enjoys it. Love it . Easy to use. No problems setting it up!!!! Very impressed; set up a little confusing, but overall a good experience. Still learning. However, Best Buy emails give away any gift secrets !! Had to reset my account to a work email address. Already an amazon consumer and user of Alexa to control home automation products. The Show is a great addition for us in the kitchen, displaying receipts and visualizing things that before could only be heard. So easy to set up. Still learning what she can do. Happy so far. I love my echo show. Screen is so clear and sound is so high quality. I have several around the house and love playing music on them easy setup and we can now talk to each other and see each other very easy. great way to keep in touch without a computer. Great product. I‚Äôm at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition. I love the fact that I can just use my voice to use my electronic devices. Bought for sons & family they have small children and I never miss out on seeing them live .. love it It is very enjoyable to be able to listen to the music at any time and great for parties and poolside. This is a very nice concept, and I think it will take on more usefulness as Alexa gains more skills. The design is a little clunky.... Google\\'s version looks nicer, but I already has Alexa devices to tie in to. The sound quality is good,Alexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement Very similar to FaceTime on an Apple product.You can watch someone show you how to do something, like a project you are working on. Instead of listening, you can see it! Alexa is now a family member. How have I lived my life without her I have no idea........... Nice except unlike a Google Home you can‚Äôt just ask it to play music. You eventually have to purchase their music after s free trial Alexa is there to answer those questions you do not have an answer for along with news and weather This is a fantastic item & the person I bought it for loves it. Echo Show is everything I thought it would be and more. The alarm and music actions are the greatest. It syncs with my Echo, displays slideshows, recipes, and lists, controls my Fire Stick, and sounds pretty good. It doesn\\'t play You Tube videos but it does do a good job playing videos. The Echo Show is hands down the best device of the Echo lineup. I‚Äôve bought at least one of everyone except the Tap. I use this to call and check on my grandparents, who I got one for Christmas. It‚Äôs amazing watching my arlo and ring cameras on the screen. Also watching news segments and looking at cooking recipes/videos is great. It‚Äôs also the easiest to set up of the Echo Devices, you don‚Äôt even need to use the app, I bought this so my kids can talk to there Grandpa and it has been Great they call him all the time I bought this for my business to monitor the arlo security cameras and it is amazing! This is a perfect upgrade to my kitchen Amazon Echo. The speaker itself is a substantial upgrade over the Echo and Dot. I have it connected to my Nest security cams and it\\'s great to check on my dogs when they are having play time in my fenced backyard. It can be a bit distracting with it\\'s random invitations to \"try\" certain skills, but the distraction is worth it! This product absolutely represents the future that I imagined when I first watched Back to the Future 2 decades ago! The only con\\'s that I can think of is sometimes Alexa doesn\\'t hear me so well (same for the Echo and Dot) and it currently can\\'t differentiate between users like Google Home can. I have had the Google Home too, and would highly recommend any of the Amazon devices over the Google Home. This is my 5th Amazon Alexa product. I used to have the Alexa Echo, but moved that up to my bedroom. Now I use the Echo Show downstairs and has good sound quality. I also like that I can add my Home Security system to operate through it and can see all my cameras. Great product. Works well. Haven\\'t been able to work out the local traffic yet. Love my amazon echo show however I wish Alexa knew a little bit more. I bought this as a gift for my daughter\\'s 22nd birthday and she totally loved it. Now she\\'s wanting me to buy a second one so that I can keep it on the first floor. She says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other. I think it was a great purchase so I think I\\'m going to have to buy another one. Works good. Have to be very careful with kids. Overall good product Addition to my system...love talking and seeing my BFF in ATL...SUITS MY OFFICE decor. Got this so Grandma could stay in touch with Grandchildren, Works great and easy to use This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale. It\\'s neat. It does what all other amazon alexis\\' do, but a little more. I feel as if should still do more. This is a great device when used with Ring camera and Hue lighting. Thoroughly enjoy my new show. Love the scrolling pictures. I brought my tube amplifier to Best Buy and my Magnolia rep hooked it up to a pair of B&W 700 Series 2 speakers. WOW...It sounded like Etta James was right in the room! Fantastic! Works great. Very responsive and quick. I love tying the whole house together with this and the echoes. Love the look- love the size- love that it is VISUAL!! I like it. Currently it is the only smart system with display. It makes it easier to talk to the device. My only issue with it that it has a slow processor. Yes, it‚Äôs a little glitchy sometimes. But so useful and fun! I‚Äôm hoping that over time Amazon will continue to improve on the errors in Alexa. When contacting customer service, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Amazon is very interested in learning the problems that need fixing though. Great item to upgrade your house. Works very well. Very cool - It fully incorporates all of my Smart Home products Very happy with adding Alexa to the kitchen! The Echo Show is great for looking up recipes, getting a weather and traffic up as I‚Äôm getting my morning coffee or just listening to music! Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy. They also enjoy music on demand. Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam. I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill, made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem. Useless is no help; less than useless actually makes more work. The Echo Show is less than useless. This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it. After about a week you\\'re going to be wondering what else can I do? what else can this help you with? So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start. Then prioritize the purchase of an echo (not plus) and a spot. Makes things easy to do like listen to music, check the weather, hear the news,etc. just make sure you say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù loans and clear. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt hear you. Great to have for time, recipe, or entertainment I recommend everyone get it This amazon product is amazing easy to set up and to use. I do recommend getting prime music with it for only 4.99 a month that‚Äôs a deal. The family and I love Alexa view and once we got it we were hooked now everything in the house and outside is run by voice commands. The opportunities with this are endless. I recently had purchased enough smart home devices to make this a good addition for the home. It works well with smart outlets, our Ring doorbell and fairly well with our Nest Thermostat.My only complaint is that sometimes for no reason it will start plying a movie trailer and it\\'s hard to get it to stop. Still all in all we\\'re happy with the purchase. It can stream music really well and not just from Amazon.I was expecting it to be smart like Watson, but it is more like an Blank Stare. Amazon should look into predicting questions like during 2017 Superbowl Play Offs. Alexa was unable to display or update the Play Off Brackets. It understands my voice really well, were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what I am saying. It want pair to my Portable Bluetooth Speaker. It will pair to my cell phone, but only to receive Music from it.The Audio quality is varies with amplitude. With low amplitudes Alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room, but an amplitude setting of about 50% the audio becomes clear and understandable. I really like playing games like Jeopardy with Alexa. No climbing through the closet to find a box anymore, and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing. Amazon hit it out of the park with this one. I am able to connect this to NEST cams and Ring cams as well. Songs come with lyrics, sound and looks great. Echo Show does everything from weather to turning on/ off my lights I am so happy to have the Echo Show. I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music. It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some. loved the echo show. my only complaint is that youtube will no longer be available on it. That is one of the main reasons I purchased this as a gift. Other than that the product is great. Easy to use. This Amazon Echo is very user friendly, and provides hours of entertainment, with anything from recipes, news, videos, and Amazon music with the lyrics is like having your own Karaoke. I have multiple Echo devices so purchasing another was a no brainer. I enjoy this one as it is video capable. The only thing I wish they would add was a way to pivot the camera and or improve its low light capabilities for poorly lite rooms. I have had the Echo Show for about a month now. So this review is from a new user whom has never had smart devices aside from cell phones. Alexa is great for listening to music, most of it free if you\\'re an Amazon Prime member, pair your Echo device with a bluetooth speaker for awesome sound. Alexa works well with smart home devices such as light bulbs, outlets and thermostat. (Most of these are really easy to set up, so you don\\'t have to be a very technical person.) All of which can be voice controlled or remotely via the Alexa app from your smart phone. If you have a friend with an Echo Show, you can make video calls via the devices or directly to a smart phone which is pretty awesome for family and friends whom live far away. As far as answering questions, do not expect the best answers. The Bing search engine needs some work. If you want to ask the questions she prompts you with on an Echo show, she\\'s your girl, but if you want to know something, you might have to look it up yourself. IE; weather forecast, you get whatever Bing uses and the short version. If Bing would expand their horizons in searches, I would definitely 5 star this item. She does fairly well with recipes and shopping lists. I am going to be trying out the calendar sync portion of this with my wife after the holidays. All in all, very fun, helpful, item. It can order you pizza too. Is better than face time when calling my kid, since they have one, IÔ∏è could call them from my and see them at the same time, perfect for cooking timer n best for music Setting up the amazon show was a little tricky,but I managed to navigate through it. It‚Äôs so cool to add compatible equipment. I have really enjoyed these products so much I actually bought 3 of them. Fun to watch and even better if you are an Amazon Prime customer for music and video. As advertised...................................... I love my echo show it does so many interesting things I‚Äôm on it all the time I recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting up to date information I am enjoying the Echo Show a lot.Very entertaining I had looked at this for a while. I was thinking about purchasing it when Amazon was offering the buy on get the second one for less offer, but when both they and Best Buy dropped the price to $149 I jumped on it. It\\'s perfect for my kitchen because I can use the screen to pull up recipes and I can video chat with my kids that live out of State. I would say that this is a great addition to any Smart Home. Absolutely love the Amazon Alexa devices, we now have six in our house and have them connected to Sonos, nest, Arlo and other devices I purchased it so the weather and info can be seen on the screen. At the time I never knew there was an echo spot or I would have tried that. The show sounds good however I wish there was a ring or something on top that would light up like the original alexa. Easy to install, very easy to use, we enjoy the product and learn more about it all the time Great item for the new home. Better than purchasi. This is a good product We have the original Echo, two Echo Dots and the Echo Show to complete the family - love the ability to play videos and the lyrics display on Prime Music is awesome! Bought two of these. one for the living room and one for the bedroom. great when you dont feel like walking to the living room and need to talk to your significant other. honestly dont use it much, but when i do its great. music shopping stupid questions movie times etc. I bought this for our kitchen where we enjoy cooking and congregating. Streaming music is great and you can search for recipes just by asking Alexa. Our whole family loves, and uses this device for so many different features. We love using it to make phone calls, watch films, play Jeopardy, even to define words as they come up in conversation. We definitely get a lot of use out of this device, more than any other screen, tablet, or smart phone device we own. FUN TO USE FOR ANY AGE JUST SAY ALEXA\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" A nice \"next step\" in the Alexa repertoire; easy to set up and to use. It is so convenient to have a display with Alexa function. I Searched online and talked with people for two weeks before purchasing. When I went to purchase the echo show amazon dropped the price. Love this product am glad I purchased it. Having a blast listening to any kind of music and asking questions. So we added this to our Echo family of devices. It\\'s nice to have screen, but I honestly don\\'t find I use it as much as I thought I would. The video calling feature would be pretty great IF we knew more people with a video capable Echo device.... Also, we\\'ve had some technical issues that I haven\\'t been able to resolve as of yet. Ultimately, this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter. It\\'s also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras, but you should probably investigate it\\'s features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more \\'traditional\\' echo devices. It\\'s essentially an Alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker, so something to think about. this product features a beautiful screen to enhance your viewing and information, love this product Simply love it! It‚Äôs loud... love watching videos!! This product is amazing. I do however wish that there were more video features on it! I love my Echo Show! Easy to set up! And fun to use!! The echo show is a great accessory to any house . It has a great picture on it and great sound . It‚Äôs simple to use . My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists . Also listens to music with crisp sound. Can ask Alexa pretty much anything . This item seems great on the ads, but it reality it can‚Äôt do nearly as much. To get it to do more you have to download ‚Äúskills‚Äù, some of which work well and others of which do not. Some are reviewed, but many are not. Connecting is often difficult and sometimes the password you use has to be the same as your Alexa device (which no body tells you). I‚Äôm sure with some practice this device will be fun and useful, but learning to use it and sorting through the skills is a pain. Upgraded from echo to this and this is just what I needed. Works well with my new Ring door bell and security cameras. Love the versatility of this. Echo Show is a great addition to any home and we were thrilled to buy one for each of our children\\'s families during this holiday season! With this you can make calls to other echo shows. Or using the app you can call others that have the a show. I haven\\'t used this feature yet since I\\'m the only one I know who has one. I can tell you that while using the app at home or away from home off the network you can call the show. I did this while at work to check it out and caught my son coming in the back door. I freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome! You could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever, wherever you have it. Keep in mind you\\'re only gonna see what it\\'s pointed at. The camera doesn\\'t move. Plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward. There are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down. Almost forgot but the speakers are amazing! You can link multiple echos together to play music. I have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a JBL speaker in another room. After set up through the app I can tell Alexa to play music and they all come to life. Love the new Echo Show! Picture is clear and the microphones pick up my voice from far away. My wife likes it for recipes on the go and the Show it is always thinking. Music sounds great coming from this small unit. It was the talk of Christmas! Got this as a gift for my sister and her fianc√© and they love it. Works great with Phillips Hue I love this new Alexa device with the screen. I bought it for my mother who really couldn\\'t \"relate\" to the Echo Dot. But she can read the output. I works seamlessly with my Apple Calendar so she can see her activities of the day. Also can call her Great Grandchildren just by talking, and see them too! I own a dot and a first gen echo and the sound from the show is way better than both of my other echoes. The video functions are nice but it is a pain to get it to play videos from my Amazon library. My family enjoys the calendar info and the news briefings that rotate on the screen. We already love our other Alexa/Echo devices and this is our favorite. The drop in video chat feature is my favorite! Nice to see songs, and many other items. Shows words to music, can watch u tube. And video calls. Nice to have .good thing to used love to . Would tell people about I like the Echo Show. I can view my cams, watch a movie and read the news. The camera video is slightly delayed. And I do wish it had a jack for earphones. But the sound on mine is good. I have dots and an echo and this just sounds better and looks better I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. The screen is big and alexa responds clearly and quickly. Bought it for my son & wife. They love it. Both thought they didn‚Äôt need it. They find that it is a lot of fun and very useful. Very impress with the echo show and all of its features I think this is one of Amazon best products ever. I first review the echo online and watch youtube video. It is better than I read or saw on line. This device is seriously cool. The basic functions out of the box are nice, but some customization and configuration allow you to do so much more. My family loves the ability to play Amazon music with their voice. Smart home integration is a big draw! Nice device. We use it a lot in the kitchen and the home automation. The video is pretty good and the speaker is better than I thought it would be. If Amazon and Google can work things out, the Show will be amazing! We already loved the Echo and the Dot, and were looking forward to adding video. Unfortunately, YouTube is no longer on the Show, limiting the video content. If they can ever get it back, the Show will definitely be a 5 star product! The show is definitely amazing, especially if you have the doorbell with video and security cameras, you can see it with echo show. I love this product! The possibilities are endless! It\\'s great! I love the hand free whatever you want. It plays videos on Amazon by just asking it to play. At work I can video call my girlfriend at home with the show as well. Highly recommend Purchased to stay in touch with family while traveling. Absolutely Awesome! Great product, recommend that Everyone have one! Traded my original echo for echo show. Glad I did, screen is excellent and syncs with many home connected devices. Promising product that has been getting better with software updates since release. I upgraded from Echo and have no regrets. I didn\\'t liked design from day 1 but after mounting on the wall the screen looks good. I like it more then I except it. Much easier for reordering or shopping on Amazon. Amazon echo show working very well (as expected) and thanks to Amazon for adding more features on regular basis. The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen. I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions, and you can view videos too. I also like that you can see the temperature, and date without having to ask. I like you can view a video of a recipe, not just see text. The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system.I have two dots and love them. The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system. Even though this feature does not exist, it still is a great product. Delivered on time and it looked good will hook it up next year. This is the most amazing item. And very easy to use I use alexa to control my smart home and get internet information Best Xmas gift and great product made by amazon. Now my fam is all connected. bought these for family members out of state for Christmas, finding it is way more than expected. Can talk face to face with them, make shopping lists, listen to stories, play interactive trivia music games, is there no end to possibilities? They all LOVED their gift (thank you Best Buy for great sale to make affordable)... We purchased the Echo Show after using the Dot for a couple of weeks. The first thing I noticed is that the Dot‚Äôs ability to pick up your voice is by far much better than the Show. However, I think the Show‚Äôs speaker is better for listening to music.The screen on the Show is handy for looking at recipes, seeing the shopping list or watching the timer. Could you live with just the Dot? Absolutely, but there are some nice features that make the Show a handy gadget to have around. Amazon show is pretty cool, It can help with things like cooking recipe, homework and other things. But it\\'s restricted to only Amazon partner things. If Google comes out with something similar I would have definitely chosen that over the show. No YouTube. Love the Echo Show. Allows me to control lights, alarm, vacuum and lots of stuff. No brainer to set up. Make lists, keep up with calendar. Plays music. Tells jokes and sings‚Äîbadly but is fun. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with it. We\\'re still learning all the things this device can do. So far, We\\'re very pleased. The Show is a great little product. It has opened a lot of doors in the world of AI and home automation for me. It connected easily with my echo and dot and now I can stream music all over my house. The picture quality is outstanding. The only drawback is that Alexa doesn\\'t have a very strong internet search engine. We were interested in the Echo line of products after we purchased our Vivint security system. The Echo Show is a perfect addition. We are able to view our security cameras from the The Echo Show and it works great in general as an Echo with all its features. Great to talk and see family at anytime. Easy to use I love having the screen available to use for certain tasks like streaming doorbell video, security camera footage, Amazon Prime music lyrics and videos, but I am disappointed that Amazon‚Äôs implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violated Google\\'s terms of service so they got the app pulled from the Show. Also, honestly, and anyone can prove it just through everyday use, but the Echo is just not as useful as Google Assistant with inquiries. It works pretty well with home automation but it just doesn\\'t understand or can\\'t help with about half of the inquiries I throw at it. I would have gone with a Google Home if there was one with a touchscreen. I would recommend it for those heavily invested in Amazon Prime and home automation. Love it Love it Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love this. Just replaced my old echo with this one. Love Alexa. This is great! Like having a robot brain in your house. Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own \\'surveillance system\\' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren\\'t quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it\\'s close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device! This is just what I was looking for. It does just what it says it does! This is perfect for any home it gives up to date news, you can set alarms and do so much more. We love this product I couldn\\'t believe how easy and fast the setup was. It\\'s basically plug and play. I watched a video first and it took no more than 3 minutes to get going. You don\\'t need any other equipment to set it up. The sound is unbelievable...better than my Bose. Upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras. Sound is much better The Echo Dot is a great personal assistant, and right now the price is fantastic. It can give you the weather forecast, traffic reports, daily news brief, play music from Pandora or other steaming radio stations, and answer questions, all in a very small package.. . Addition to my system...love talking and seeing my BFF in ATL...SUITS MY OFFICE decor. We love Alexa! Love being able to watch news briefings, seeing the lyrics to songs, and so much more! It\\'s in our kitchen and we use it everyday! I bought this so my kids can talk to there Grandpa and it has been Great they call him all the time Now I can view my front door Ring system as well as all my Arlo cameras. Great products. If you have Echo Spot in each bedroom, you can video talk with your kids by dropping in. Love it Got this for my wife for Christmas. Was suppose to come wrapped but didn‚Äôt. Wife very happy. Avid amazon fan. Sound better then the echo. Use a lot of home automation and this is a great addtion. If you are not an Alexa or home automation fan I would recomend trying to catch this on sale, you may not need the screen a much as you think. The sound quality is great. This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it. After about a week you\\'re going to be wondering what else can I do? what else can this help you with? So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start. Then prioritize the purchase of an echo (not plus) and a spot. Awesome so far. Have used it as alarm clock, stereo, 2nd screen for movies (while multitasking on PC), news/weather, audiobooks, and more. The news flash can repeat itself at times, but I may have subscribed to too many subcategories, but a quick alexa - next skips right ahead. Still learning the variations of commands, and sometimes it hears what it wants to until I have to ar. tic. u. late. to the point of annoyance, but hey, this is still relatively new tech, and who would have imagined this 20 years or more ago I like it. Needs more features to really become a good product. Needs browsing capabilities. This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale. Purchased this item for our daughter. She absolutely loves it! After researching and reading endless reviews, I bought myself an early Christmas present in the Amazon Echo Show. Once I had it home, it was quickly set up and has been a joy to have since day one. Loved it so much I bought two more as gifts. So enjoying being able to see friends and family on a more regular basis with the video option. I‚Äôm sure as I learn more this will become even more useful. Great addition to my other Echo devices. Alexa is a wealth of knowledge and learning more and more every day. I didn\\'t think I needed Alexa to have a screen, but now I\\'m so glad we got this. When I ask to see my grocery list, it pops up on the screen. Also can do video calls from it. Really like our Alexa and the dots...we have them in almost every room of the house now. I am very pleased with the sound and picture quality. It does not link to direct tv. This was a Black Friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and Alexa worked well with the Ring doorbell system. There are times when you have to ask her the same thing over and over until she figures it out but overall it was a food deal. Love talking face to face with family and friends back in the Philly area. It is easy to use and to stay in touch. I can show family things that I have recently bought by holding it up to the camera instead of having to go into a long description on a phone line. Once you have it, you can\\'t live without it. Great product. The show works great with my other products. Love it Love the echo show & the ability to communicate with smaller children without any effort or cell phones. The echo show works very well with Bluetooth and WiFi. Great sound and screen. Recommend to anyone All I really use it for is music. The read downfall is it‚Äôs not Bluetooth so it has to be plugged in 24/7 I have all the echo products in this by far is the best it does everything . I love it! We\\'re hoping the Echo show will allow us to elevate our experiences using the screen options for calling family & friends as well as reading recipes etc. So I was skeptical of Echo Show and the entire line to be honest. However, this technology has changed how our household operates. From my daily briefing in the morning, to tracking Santa with my 6 year old every morning learning interesting facts about Santa and several other things, I truly wish I would have bought this sooner. We have it integrated into our Cozi account so we can just ask Alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in. We also have ADT Pulse and a Nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple I couldn\\'t believe it. My son loves to ask Alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon.Another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is. I am loving the Amazon Music now as well because we bought an Echo Dot just to integrate into our Bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now.If you are on the fence about getting the Echo Show like I was, just do it. It really is an amazing product! I will have one for all my rooms. I will also buy some for friends I can see my grandchildren when I call it is a great machine Love the screen and being able to see video along with my cameras on my Vivint smart home Absolutely Love the echo Show! It is in my kitchen. I love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there. My calendar is there too. Plus I scroll pictures on it from my Amazon prime photos. Love being able to get the daily news briefing from MPR every morning. Also use it for timing things. Would highly recommend it to Amazon prime members. Got it at a great price on sale prior to Christmas. Amazon built upon the success of their Echo. I\\'m really enjoying the convenience of the Echo with the added display. I have put this in the kitchen to use for recipes and controlling various devices. Not a very responsive program. Very limited information program. Not user friendly. The echo show is a great accessory to any house . It has a great picture on it and great sound . It‚Äôs simple to use . My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists . Also listens to music with crisp sound. Can ask Alexa pretty much anything . The Amazon Echo Show is so much fun! I got it for my husband for Christmas and its absolutely more of a gift for myself! We also got hue lights and have set it up our routines. This show is so much fun! We listen to the news in the morning while making coffee, it wakes us up with slowly with the hue lights, we listen to music while cooking dinner... cant recommend it more! Because of this purchase, I am also buying a spot! We love the camera feature where you can \"drop in\" so we will continue buying these rather than the security cameras (for the inside at least where we just want to say hello or see our dog). Worked better than expected! Highly recommend the Echo Show I‚Äôve always loved the amazon Alexa smart products and use them to control my smart home setup. Purchased to stay in touch with family while traveling. Love this product, able to read recipes instead of just hearing them. Speaker is pretty good too. I use the echo show to stream music, video chat, and drop in as a camera from my home. You can even see recipes and other items. Worth the money, got it on sale! I always wait for sales. at first I wasnt sure if this was something I \"needed\" when I already have the echo but it was on sale for black friday so I thought why not. As soon as it was set up I understood why I \"needed\" this. It just enhances everything Alexa does! Being able to see what she says is great! Seeing and adjusting my shopping list by touch is amazing. I love walking in the room and seeing little news blurbs. It looks sleek and beautiful on my counter. I highly recommend this to anyone. Each and Every Version of Amazon Home Products have gotten better and better. This Amazon Home is the Cadillac of Amazon Home Products. The News Feed on the screen at all times along with the options and features that you can do with this is amazing. I love the ability to call my mom and dad and see what they are doing. They are only a couple of miles away but it is fun. I also love playing music on the device since most of songs include the words. You might find out that you have been singing the wrong lyrics for as long as you can remember. I control all my smart home sthings with it, and also have 2 echo dots I LOVE MY ECHO SHOW, ELEXA IS SO HELPFULL SHE ANSWERS JUST ABOUT EVERY QUESTION I HAVE I like the video feature for my doorbell. Wish it automatically showed a picture when door bell rung. Does not FaceTime. Maybe later. Also not all cameras are compatible. With a Seamless integration and easy functionality the echo show is wonderful piece of tech that is entertaining and useful to the whole family. Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam. I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill, made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem. Useless is no help; less than useless actually makes more work. The Echo Show is less than useless. I have the spot, dot and two shows, I started out with the spot and loved it so much I wanted a bigger one. This was a (Best Buy) ! No pun intended lol The Alexa show is a great product and the price was even better I‚Äôm all about the smart home and I love my new echo show. I stay more connected with my family. I also love how it‚Äôs integrated with my Arlo, Ring, Nest, and Hue light bulbs. Love this! We have it on our kitchen counter and great for music, news updates, amazon delivery updates, recipes, timer, and soo much more! Tech is not totally friendly but for The cost and what it does it is worth the investment Great product and it is very easy to set up and use Purchased for my mom in a memory care center. She doesn‚Äôt have to answer the phone, we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us. Picture clarity awesome! Staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently. Doesn‚Äôt replace room camera but good. Would give a 5 but can‚Äôt figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her. Anyone know? Works well with smart home lights, door locks and wireless security cam Great product. I‚Äôm at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition. Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it. I like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports, etc. Still not using it to its full potential, but we have it controlling a couple of lamps, giving us weather reports, setting timers and alarms. It\\'s making me lazy! Sometimes it doesn\\'t hear my voice. Hears my husband\\'s voice better. I find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table. I am loving my Amazon Echo Show. It makes life easier! I love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking Alexa. I also love being able to video call friends and family that have an Echo Show or the Alexa App. Overall it is a great product! It is a great product. It works great would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to buy one. So having Alexa on hand could be good and bad. It\\'s nice when I\\'m cooking and I need help with a recipe but it can be annoying when my kids fight over what they want Alexa to answer. Over all it\\'s a nice product, connects to my Ring doorbell too which is nice. The Echo show is addictive. Pairs easy, fantastic sound and video and once you download the Alexa app and learn a few things it becomes indispensable. Video calls work well. Great for the office or Kitchen. I like the Echo Show. I can view my cams, watch a movie and read the news. The camera video is slightly delayed. And I do wish it had a jack for earphones. But the sound on mine is good. I like that you can Talk To Alexa. I like the lyrics to the music. I like the personal Assistant, It is So wonderful and limitless. User friendly, hand free little assistant. Makes your mornings easier and gets you started for the day. And it looks cool This has been perfect for the kitchen, it plays music & I can sing along with the words on the screen. Love that Alexa also allows for multiple timer settings when cooking. Echo Show is a great tool in the kitchen. Paired with amazon music it makes the time go by quickly. Video selection could be better (somehow needs to strike a deal with Google for access to YouTube video). It does have nice video for recipes. Amazon\\'s Echo Show has been a great help to my daily rutine. From asking simple things like the weather to more specific things like flash briefings or traffic to my commute, echo show is a great tool for any tech enthusiast I‚Äôm in love with Alexa. Love her fir music, quick weather updates and in the kitchen for recipes. It‚Äôs great getting them step by step and not having to keep putting the passcode in on my iPad with hands covered in flour. Bought as a gift for my wife, she loves it and the screen is very handy for recipes and such. She knows all the answers. I‚Äôm used to speaking to her, i recently visiting a friend and said ‚ÄúAlexa ‚Äú. And my friend looked at me like I was crazy. She doesn‚Äôt have Alexa. It is great to be able to make video calls from the kitchen. Very convenient. Needs to be a stand alone device. I should have not required to use a tablet of Cell phone to make it work. Amazon needs to work on the technology on device. This was bought for a gift. But it looks nice. Just what was expected I have not used this as it is a gift for my parents. Will see how they like it. a bit difficult to set up, but it is amazing. Love the screen! with this echo line, we are able to watch amazon prime, and even do visual calls to grand daughter! Great to give as gifts. I bought several items for staff. I have several around the house and love playing music on them I bought this as a gift for my husband and he is constantly asking Alexa questions about everything. We love listening to music on it as well. The touch screen adds a new dimension to the Echo which comes in handy when ordering off of Amazon or reorders as well. I also like being able to view news briefings and song lyrics on the screen also. The Echo Show is the only way to go. The Echo show screen is great, it is helpful with recipes, music etc. I use it to listen to music all the time. I am hoping someone in my family gets one soon so we can face time each other. I bought the echo after seeing it demonstrated by my brother. He proceeded to ask Alexa questions and Alexa would answer them immediately. He then asked it to pull up some songs which, it did right away. Then he asked it to call mom and it did that as well. Needless to say, i had to get one. We bought two of these for the kids. They love them and I now have an echo dot I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon , i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code, nothing... then a nother one... and still nothing , i started to set up the device at 8.30 am and by 11.20 am i was fed up with it.. i had to step away.... after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon .... I. Like the visual with this echo although I think I would have enjoyed it more if this was my first and only alexa I bought this device for my wife and she loves it. Plays videos for cooking. 1 on gift list. For sure. We use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera! Works great we tell it to show us the camera ,and boom, there‚Äôs the video feed. Super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show!! The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However, the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But, who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues. All in all I am getting used to the features and like it. Alexa runs my entire house. The Echo show is a great addition to the Echo family. Everyone needs one! Staff was very helpful and polite ! Went in asked for help and was pointed in the right direction! Absolutely love this. We got the lights and they have worked so great. Great Smart speaker for my 90 year old mother in law. I‚Äôm an amazon prime member and the show is awsum I use it to communicate with the son who lives in Seattle. You can watch amazon pirime tv,play amazon music. Text, play games read the lyrics while the song is playing. I love it We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it! Love the new echo show. has so many more features that my echo dot. I had been looking for the product for a while. After much research, I bought it and I am not disappointed. It is a great product. I can tell I won\\'t be bored learning all that the echo show can do. If you\\'re thinking about buying it, just go for it. The Amazon Show is a great addition to the Smart Home, easy to set up and to link up with a hub. Like having pictures and weather on the screen and news up dates It does everything amazon, and I can even see who is at the front door with Arlo! It doesn\\'t do Netflix, or Hulu, but that\\'s okay. I really like the sound, it fills small rooms. It\\'s easy now to video chat with Nana, or drop in to tell my kid\\'s goodnight, when I am working late. Facilitates easy home set-up of many Smart devices. I have really enjoyed these products so much I actually bought 3 of them. Fun to watch and even better if you are an Amazon Prime customer for music and video. Great electronic , very easy to install me and my family enjoy the things that Alexa do very satisfied with my service that I received from Best Buy when I purchase it looking forward to shopping there more often and I\\'m a new customer there The show has some nice features but the audio quality isn‚Äôt the best for the price point. I got mine on sale and am just using it for a bedroom alarm clock. I can read the time without my glasses.I still use my Sonos Play 1 to listen to my sleep playlist and ny other music. Unless I missed something it seems like if I set the volume low at night to listen to music to go to sleep my alarm will not be loud enough. So I don‚Äôt use the Show for music much. Setting up the amazon show was a little tricky,but I managed to navigate through it. It‚Äôs so cool to add compatible equipment. Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy. They also enjoy music on demand. Requires too many components. Cameras, etc. stick with basics (in my opinion). We are loving it so far! Bought with a great deal and was able to use previous best buy awards to get it cheap. We also ended up buying another one for the parents for Christmas so we can chat back and forth! I love how all the echo\\'s connect now in our home. I am so happy to have the Echo Show. I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music. It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some. When I purchased this item, I was unaware how much it really does. I can literally control my entire home with it. Echo Show is everything I thought it would be and more. The alarm and music actions are the greatest. We wanted to see how this would work and it\\'s not super accurate, but kind of fun We have Alexa and now a video version of recipes and more. Love it! Ok so i normally do not like this kind of stuff, but to be honest Alexa has been great, not only do we use it for fun stuff like music while cooking, or being able to multi task much easier, it fit in seamlessly with our home security system, added a extra cam, and really does add something extra to the home Video integration it\\'s big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check who\\'s at the door when doorbell rings. The show has a good picture and good sound...love using it to look things up I bought this as a gift. As far as know it works fine The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though. I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show, they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn\\'t totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that\\'s a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it\\'s shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system, robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful, fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home. Added screen a great features visual effect a plus We use echo almost every day. It is fun to ask questions. The music is great. We check the weather and listen to NPRnews I picked up the show on a Black Friday deal. I probably would never have paid full price. I am glad I have the show, it is actually quite useful. The sound quality is also better than the standard echo. At the moment, my only complaints are the lack of YouTube support and the price.. It will be interesting to see what features Amazon will add to the show in the future. This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both. I\\'ve being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos. The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time. I love all of my Amazon echo devices. Right now it doesn\\'t allow YouTube, but hopefully they will reach an agreement and fix that. I love the show. It was so easy to set up. I use it every day for music and weather info. Can\\'y wait to see how it works for Christmas cookies. I am totally Addicted.Easy to use. Love the call feature. The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that‚Äôs compatible with my mother‚Äôs Arlo Security cameras. It works great! The first thing we noticed was Alexa‚Äôs response time to questions. No waiting or downloading just lightning quick responses. 2nd was the compatibility with our smart hone features. She connects to our lights and security monitoring system with ease. She is clear and concise. Product is great. It is Easy to use and easy to set up This is a helpful addition to the home. It\\'s great to be able to set timers, play music, and check the news all hands free. Alexa can make you crazy but it‚Äôs worth the aggravation. This does the same things as the other echos but has a screen. The sound is comparable to the echo which is good. The screen is small, not hd, and not touch screen. You only can call other echo users.If you have an echo don\\'t run out and buy you can do all on a laptop. If you are looking at an echo having the screen might be worth the extra bucks, Upgraded from echo to this and this is just what I needed. Works well with my new Ring door bell and security cameras. Love the versatility of this. Alexa is great and even better with a screen to show you all your searches and videos First bought the Dot to see if we liked it. We enjoyed it, but wanted a little more volume. When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice. Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room. For larger rooms the Show is a great choice. Great product will recommend it to friends and family. I was hesitant, and I am now hooked. This is both fun and useful The Show sounds significantly better than the echo plus. And the added screen features are nice. I just wish the ‚Äúthings to try section‚Äù would go away This Amazon Echo is very user friendly, and provides hours of entertainment, with anything from recipes, news, videos, and Amazon music with the lyrics is like having your own Karaoke. great product with many functions I would highly recommend it to a friend. Device must be studied and practiced with to gain max use of its robust capacity . We bought the Echo Show to get the hyped benefits of Alexa, and home automation. After using for a week, we decided to return the Echo Show. Alexa just isn\\'t ready for prime time. 90% of the time we got the \"I can\\'t answer that\" response to questions. It\\'s a waste of money for us. Say \"Alexa, Say good bye!\" This product ties in to the Amazon ecosystem better than the Dot or Echo. It provides better sound quality and plays video. Pairing this off with Nest cameras has been the best. So quick and easy. I highly recommend this product. Alexa can do it all! Having a severe hearing loss, the \\'Show\\' gives me visuals along with captions so that I can follow what Alexa is saying! The Echo show with video screen is a nice upgrade to the other echo‚Äôs. News briefs with videos are nice. Very good sound quality for playing music. This is the only one you need ! it\\'s like having the Dot, Echo and IHome all in one with a screen ! So great to instantly see family members to chat, demonstrate, check-in... PLUS all the wonderful features of the Echo devices including video clips, movies, etc . It is amaizin I like the way you type and search my favorites This has quickly become one of the most used at the kitchen counter! If you have Alexa an you like it, a must have upgrade. This is our second Show. And, one of several Christmas gifts. These are convenient and fun! Easy to set up. We use our Alexa devices as whole house intercom and for listening to music. I use Alexa every day. I do not know how I lived with out her before We purchased the Amazon - Echo Show with Alexa in store. Took it home and after connection wi-fi it was great. we cannot wait to buy light bulbs and a thermostat. Great buy Does exactly what we wanted it to do. Very easy voice commands. Love this new Echo Show.The best in the Alexa family Bought the eco show to replace my first gen eco (the original tube). The show hears and understands me a lot better. I love my Alexa Show. It can answer most of my questions and I use it for recipes and listening to music. I use it everyday. The screen is a great upgrade. Music lyrics are displayed with good quality speakers. Very convenient for recipes and you can make hands free calls with great audio quality. Great product! I bought the Echo Show because a friend of mine was excited about his. I\\'m hoping it makes a great Christmas present for our family. I bought the white version and have it in the kitchen. I use it for EVERYTHING, music, video, phone, security cams, news, weather. It\\'s the perfect kitchen assistant. BUY IT !The video adds great value to the songs, news, etc.Also, accessing videos such as Netflix adds greatly. The echo show feels useless after a few hours, especially without the ability to watch YouTube. This device is especially useful if you know others who own it. It offers the same features as the standard Echo, along with an expanded feature set as well. My entire family loves this product. We ask her questions and go to sleep with her playing music. You feel like you have company anytime you want This is a must have is great for recepies, while you are cooking Alexa gives you the info. For the ines that are used to a tablet or iPod that you have to stop and read this is awesome plus. So much easier to follow things. Got this for two days during the holidays. Very good service Amazon - Echo Show is the best of all my Amazon products. I love the hands-free but able to see things on the screen. I love this thing! It‚Äôs so fun and easy to use. My 3 year old even uses it to play the trolls or lion king soundtrack Love having this in my kitchen. Play music, ask questions, make list, set timers, etc. Overall works well. Sound better than dot. Screen is clear. 9the screen doesn\\'t show as much as I thought it would but it works great and the speaker seems good on it. I haven‚Äôt used this yet, it is a gift for my father but I think he‚Äôll love it. I own a dot and a first gen echo and the sound from the show is way better than both of my other echoes. The video functions are nice but it is a pain to get it to play videos from my Amazon library. My family enjoys the calendar info and the news briefings that rotate on the screen. Video calls work great and the screen is super informative. I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :) Very easy to set up and use. Really like the screen to view the items searched for, and to read information about the searched item. I recommended is very good and practice. Play music is very good quality speaker I see video. I love Love playing music and talking to Alexa and looking at my camera three the screen This product will for sure come in handy. Very easy to use. Precise,accurate,and knowledgeable. Just an average Alexa option. Does show a few things on screen but still limited. The amazon Show has to be one of the best smart home devices that every came out. Alexa, Videos, music, and drop in. Amazing product!!! I had the Echo previously, but having the screen opens up more options for Alexa. I find it helpful to be able to glance at the screen and see things like time and weather. I also have cameras setup and I can use Alexa to view these feeds. While the unit is kind of large, it is stable and supports touch. I haven\\'t tried video calling or playing videos, but the screen quality seems pretty good. Best New Adult Toy in years! Wish I had purchased one for my parents. LOVE IT!!!! I own multiple echoes and I like the show the best. The screen adds a lot of value in my opinion. I really like being able to see upcoming calendar events and daily news. My kids like watching cartoons from Amazon Prime while eating breakfast. The speakers are great and put out more than enough quality sound for their size. At $149 it was a great deal. I bought several Alexa‚Äôs for Christmas gifts also for myself also bought Amazon Show for Christmas gift also for a my youngest Daugter ! This one is the best...I have the dots but this is so nice if you have cameras just ask for that camera and you will get it on the screen.. spend the extra .. My wife said I‚Äôm developing a ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù home...while I‚Äôm still learning what all I can do with this over the regular Echo, I am looking forward to getting my Ring Doorbell installed! Great product, I can rave enough about them!!! A lazy mans drean when it is combined with Alexa. If you get the harmony hub you can really impress with home automation I really enjoy my Fire stick. It\\'s really easy to use. Really cool device! Instantly noticed the difference in quality when I switched from the regular Fire Stick to the Fire TV with 4k. Love it! Works great. One in each of the main rooms. Works great. Turns H&A up and down. Tv on and off. Lights on and off. All from Alexa. You do have to have apps and special lights. I LOVE Alexa and my Echo device (and Smart Bulb) so much I bought 4 more Echos and 8 more bulbs with more to come soon... So I went to the store, purchased and gifted.it was a snap. Love the convenience of being able to turn on a light or other appliances connected to smart switches with voice commands. Also very convenient music streaming, news and weather reports. We replaced our old echo for this one with a smart hub, works great It is a nice hub to use with lights and plugs. Sometimes echo does not work. Speaker was used as a giveaway and everyone wanted it! It was a huge hit at our conference. Would buy again. I bought this for my moms birthday and she loves it. I like this smart machine and will recommend to my friends purchased this product while was on sale, very easy to pair, looks well made, very happy with it. Love it. It‚Äôs a lot of fun. Great speakers too provides a lot of great information and fun too! Really enjoying this device so far,,,my smart phone is basic Tracfone...currently adding smart lighting...will probably switch to a tablet for controlling and adding to a future (limited) smart home Great item, we love our Echo. If only she could mow the yard for the kids.... Alexa walks you through every step which I found helpful. We have sonos speakers and a Honeywell Lyric thermostat. It took a little searching on google to get things linked. Now that they are linked we can play music in any room and change our home temperature by using Alexa. I\\'m not a techie, but after days of trying to hook up, I gave up. I don\\'t know if it was the Echo Plus or my carrier ATT Uverse causing the issue, but it would NOT connect. So, back to the store it went. Even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistance...none of it worked. Alexa Is amazin. I love the features their great.Just love it This speaker is truly amazing and being able to control my lights makes it even better My new Echo Plus has been a fun find. It is working as advertised, and we are still exploring the many, many ways you can use this device. You do need some tech savvy on apps, wifi, and willingness to do some reading on the various \"skills\" but it is well worth it. Already added an Echo Dot to the mix. Love the knowledge it gives, and easy for my older brother who does. It so technology. I enjoy the amazon Alexa. It is an lot of fun. It will be more helpful once I have completely set up./ I‚Äôve enjoy my echo since I purchased it ! The light bulbs are great to I will be buying more products Wanted one for awhile so finally got one. Works great. Way better than Siri on my iPhone. Speaker works great for music. Very happy overal These items are easy to set up. They have added value to our home. Works great! I bought 2, 1 for the kitchen and 1 for master bath. I will definitely recommend this product . The tech support is also easy and friendly. Alexa keeps my husband company during the day answering his questions. I originally purchased this to use as a Bluetooth speaker for my wife\\'s music but soon realized that we would use this much more than we thought. Ya, turning on and off lights is good and being able to dim with the included bulb is pretty great but there are hundreds of smart home type of apps that work with this including my Sony Google TV and more show up regularly. Makes it almost too easy to be lazy. Pretty fun little gadget. Kids love playing with it. Not even sure of all the things it can do yet I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.New toy! Bought 4 devices for my kids... they report its simple to start up, easy to use and fun! The ultimate lazy life is happening before my eyes. Now I love technology , always have . But let‚Äôs be honest , telling Alexa to turn the lights off and on and ask her to tell you a joke as examples . It really is great and I‚Äôm now addicted to the Hue line as well. Alexa ricks the plus is the best ever buy it you will love it Have yet to explore all the aspects. Enjoy using it daily. It is so fun to talk to Alexa, the sound is also very high quality, I am very happy with my purchase. One of my favorite purchases. Very easy to set up. Already works with Dish hope Directv gets it soon. I saw this product used by friends and was so impressed, I bought one for my husband for Christmas. . Love being able to turn a light on when I walk inside with no hands! Alexa is a lifesaver So far I have used Alexa to play music. My only comment would be that I wish there was a larger variety of opera music. bought this as a present for the wife, but as I relaxed for the holiday requested six hours of different song play. The wife enjoyed the music as the music emanated through the open areas of our house. The wife received information on measures for recipes, weather updates, etc. this will be one of those classic gifts. Echo is nice but it could be better allowing you to connect to anything that is on your WIFI network without having to buy several different hubs. I need to buy all the additional parts but it‚Äôs great I have enjoyed learning about home automation using Echo plus and consumers need to know that this comes with having to buy additional equipment to get the most out of Alexa. I love this product! I love everything about it!!! I have two dots and this and the functionality between them is awesome. I can‚Äôt wait to see how it improves through time. Great quality speaker and build. Really enjoy having the echo to use to control the lights and music in our house Wife loves her Alexa. Uses it with her pandora and the kids love talking to it. I love Alexa although sometimes she has a hard time understanding so I find myself repeating commands such as ‚ÄúAlexa turn off lights in bedroom‚Äù . Overall she‚Äôs amazing and she tells jokes and very up to date with current events We have several, this one was a Christmas gift for our daughter. We love the convenience of creating lists and some home automation. Once you get started, you come up with more things to use it for. Great way to introduce family and friends to A.I. Technology. this is my third Alexa and combined with my fire TV and now the lights my couch time has increased. Love the new technology!! What an amazing piece of technology. I was impressed with the sound quality I bought it for my family and everyone loves it! Definitely recommend buying one! I gave as a gift to my kids for Christmas, they are enjoying Alexa. This was a present for my mother, very fun! She loves looking things up and it\\'s easier to talk it out. Alexa is amazing and the Phillips bulb works seamlessly with it. This is such a great addition to our house! Amazon Echo plus is incredible for all the things it is capable of doing. We use Alexa to ask simple questions like - what time is the basketball game? and she usually responds correctly. If you ask a more detailed question, she may not have an answer. We like to play Jeopardy and listen to local radio stations using Alexa. I am sure the device will get better with more use and updates. Decided to go for the model just below this one. I didn\\'t need the integrated \"hub\" features. (Phillips Hue does require this, but I decided to stick with my current Insteon hub). I love this product and it was one of my Best Buy‚Äôs from best buy Waste of money, ask Alexa a question and you are lucky if you get an answer instead of I\\'m not sure. I love how Alexa can control almost all smart things and help control lights and power on and off devices to help us get ready for the day. The music is connected directly to Amazon Prime Music and I love how the sound is clear and crisp. You can call out to Alexa from far away and she‚Äôll add items to your shopping list and the Alexa app is so simple to view the lists and control your smart things. I have an Echo that I bought from Best Buy several months ago. So when it came to buying one for my son & his family for Christmas I knew where to come. It‚Äôs an excellent information hub! Perfect start for smart home.works perfect with Echo I take 1 star off, because I had problems to syncing it with my W-FI. This was a great purchase! I love my echo plus with the hue light bulb. The set up is really easy and you can hook up your amazon account and order from Alexa. You can program your lights to be turned on at a certain time every day or even download the app and turn them on remotely. I love how this product is compatible with nest products. Good stereo sound, but will not control some devices without the use of an external hub. Easy to use no Complains at all. Added all the smart plugs to the skills and works perfect. This is my first Amazon Echo and it was a great buy. The Echo Plus works amazing. The voice control of the lights in my house works perfect. No need for a hub. I love having Alexa in my home. Alexa has helped from recipes to relaxing sleep sounds all night Purchased my first Amazon Echo Plus after researching online and watching video reviews. A friend of mine had one and he showed me the features. The device was easy to setup and has worked great since. I use it to control lights, fans and play music. Having a great experience using the Alexa Echo plus product. Pleased with Alexa. Have not used light yet. I‚Äôll update after use Love my Alexa! Having lots of fun asking her questions and enjoy listening to music on it. I also have the smaller echo and this sounds much better. Love all the features! They are both responsive to each other and it gives me convenience. I don\\'t have to turn off the lights and all I do is lay down and ask Alexa to turn off the light. All my lights are connected to my Echo Plus. My family have enjoyed ALEXA in the house, she is very smart and she does lots of research for the family! We are truly glad that we made the purchase Great entertainment when friends are over. The knowledge and jokes are tons of fun. This is the second one I‚Äôve bought this year for gifts This Alexa series 2 sounds better and preforms better than the previous model. It picks up the voices 10x better and the sound quality is on a Bose level(fills the whole room). Me and my family spends more quality time on the product! I have had the competitive products and nothing compares. Alexis is the new favorite name. Great for the college student Great Echo!! Friend really liked it!! It really does what he wants it to do and he connected his lights to the device. Everything works well. So far so good. I enjoy being able to communicate with friends and family using the Drop In Feature. Alexa a great product the light too. They are working fine. Great sound for the money. Easy to set up also have a dot that I like Love the sound, I have a google home and is not as loud as this echo A must have!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone should get one. great sound , easy to use, wife love it, connect with wifi and all my phones. and practical easy to use just the start of my IOT home We love our Alexia! We mostly use it for music and to control the lights. Very pleased to have this new Echo Plus and get started on automation of the home in stages. Knowing that it can continue to improve with new products and apps is a plus for owning this device. Bought one for Living Room and the other for the bedroom. Home wifi needs to be boosted but Alexa would connect through out which caused complications along with Bluetooth speakers. Once straightened out works great. I have no idea how my family ever lived without these products! Since purchasing the Alexa Hub and Hue bulb, we\\'ve purchased Echo Dots for our kitchen and son\\'s room. We absolutely love the convenience of the bulbs and Alexa is a life saver on so many levels. This was a present for my husband who originally had asked for a radio for his home office. He set it up relatively quick and was amazed at the sound quality. He loved the versatility and that he could have a specific radio station played or a random song as well as tell a joke, etc. It has been fun for all of us and we are looking into getting the smaller \"dots\" for other rooms now. He commented that he would NEVER get rid of this! It\\'s very fun and functional. The Smart bulb is very handy as well. Love it! I have been contemplating purchasing an Echo product for some time now. I finally did it and I am so pleased I did. It was extremely easy to set up. I add my lights to the process and now it is so easy to turn lights on before I get to the room. For me, I know this will be the tip of the iceberg. I will now start looking at what else I can add to the Echo. Love the product. Great Buy!!! I got this for my husband. He likes it and the setup is easy. I wasn\\'t sure I would use this item when I purchased it for my family. However, I just signed up for Amazon unlimited music after testing it on radio stations and playing games with the grandkids. I want to hook up the lighting feature as well. Speaker is excellent quality and quite enjoyable to listen to. I really enjoy the Echo plus. Speaker sorry bds good for playing music and I enjoy having Alexa turn on my lights. Works great very easy to install made connecting other devices even easier A wonderful use of creativity and design, where installation was a breeze and use was pure enjoyment I purchased this as a second Alexa. Couldn\\'t figure out why it came with the Hue Light bulb until I learned that the new version of Alexa has a built-in hub. It\\'s a gift for my spouse, but I can\\'t wait to set it up and get more bulbs to automate our home lighting. Great addition to all the other electronics in our home Bought the Amazon - Echo Plus + Philips Hue Bulb - Black for my kitchen it is awesome also came with free smart bulb. Love my Echo Plus, echo, echo spot and Ech show. Very satisfied with the products. They work great individually or with each other. Installation was easy. Directions for use was excellent. Best buy employees were very helpful explaining the product. Best buy always makes the buying process very easy and enjoyable. Looking forward to using the echo plus for many years. Great product. Works as advertised and fun to use. It is goodagood and accurate..it is very convienient. great for the elderly, makes life a lot easier for everyone I purchased two Amazon in Echo Plus and two dots plus four fire sticks and the hub Philips hue for lamp for the family at Christmas 2017. I‚Äôm so happy with these purchases and learning so much with Alexa. You can start your daily routine with Alexa and program it to whatever you would like to include news weather music horoscope ALSO you can start your day off with a compliment and I think is very important. Alexa gave me the BEST CHILI RECIPE I MEAN THE BEST it‚Äôs called Chili I. I want my husband to use Alexa to stay organized for business dates and reminders. This is the way to go I think these products are great. I enjoy using them. Great sound and function! ‚ù§Ô∏è Alexa! The color and style of the silver plus looks great with our newly finished basement. Very good price for the product. Sounds good and fun and easy to set up. Still seeing if if I like alexa like to try and set up lighting Love the shopping lists feature, listening to music ... having so much fun I have several Amazon Echo\\'s throughout my house. Home automation is great and these work with everything that I have. This is a great product but we exchanged the unit for the 2nd generation because of space limitations. It works great too. Have 1st gen Echo and Dot and a 2nd gen Dot. Wanted this over regular Echo, because I prefer the look and better speakers. Since installing the Amazon Echo we have been having fun with talking to Alexa. Also the music feature is great I had my doubts when I first purchased it. But after just a day I had synced it with my thermostat, lights, TV, Bose sound system, and many more. Amazing product.. couldn‚Äôt be happier. Great device, but I noticed based on the WiFi connection that Alexa can react slower at times. Especially when asking the device to turn off bulbs, or any smart devices. It\\'s nice to be able to listen to music in the morning and setting reminders is extremely helpful and I love being able to operate my light bulb remotely Took it out of the box and played with it for a while. Then I lost connection with it and now it no longer recognizes my phone #. Called Amazon they said they would work on the problem, no call back yet. Great and easy even for someone that is not tech savvy Echo Plus is everything I expected and more. Plus easy to set up. GREAT PRICE FOR HOLIDAYS COMBO WORKS WELL NO NEED FOR EXTERNAL HUB Hard to review as I purchased for my son as a present The bundle will help to test Philips hue light. Purchased additional tplink plug. It is an ok device but I find Google home to be better and more promising in the future Love, love, love my echo plus! Is great that it has a built in bridge...great way to start a system for your smart home!Love being able to program lights to come on and off from phone... This Echo has great sound for such a a small device. It is easy to set up and use. I am finding new tasks Alexa can do each day. I bought this for my mom and dad they loved it. Thank you So yesterday evening i decided to purchase an Amazon Echo. Is the machine intrusive yeah i guess it could be if you allow it. I purchased it because of its home automation and other fantastic capabilities. Just to name a few of those capabilities. With a subscription you will have an unprecedented amount of music you can listen to, that in itself was worth it. Some other things include sports travel recipes and traffic. The home automation part lock doors turn on lights random lighting when on vacation.. We love Alexa! Great addition to our family! Lol But seriously, you can rely on Alexa.... Alexa turns on the lights and when I say ‚Äú Alexa good night‚Äù she turns them off. Love her! Got this as a present for my fianc√© for Christmas will update I enjoy Alexa, she reminds me of appointment and alerts me when my packages arrive. The Amazon - Echo Plus is good buy it buy it you will love it Fun gadget. Plays songs, various entertainment, still learning all it can do We purchased 3 of the Eco Plus and out two adult children really like their Eco Plus. They are having a lot of fun with it we are still learning Great item and easy to use. Very helpful and entertaining Excellent product. Turns on and off supported devices by asking it. Live walking into a room and asking Alexa to turn on a light. Poof it‚Äôs done. Or locking and unlocking the front door. Arming and disarming my security system. If you‚Äôre looking to turn your house into a smarthome I strongly recommend the Amazon Echo Plus Received an Echo Plus as a Christmas present. Absolutely love it. We went back & purchased a Dot & more light bulbs. Salesman told me the big one was better so I bought it. My daughter gave me the small one for Christmas. Does the same thing. Salesmen are apparently undertrained or a bunch of liars! I love this product and plan to expand my Alexa and Echo network. Purchased as a gift for the family. Can‚Äôt wait to use it. I already had the 1st gen Echo. This one has considerably more options that I can use. I highly recommend this item. Is a notch up product.. with inbuilt hub, echo has opened up the door for easy connectivity with other products. If you like to control smart gadgets this is definitely for you! Gave it as a gift to provide a sense of safety and security for someone living in the country. Turning the lights on before entering the house is a big deal when you live alone. The Echo Plus was demonstrated for us at Best Buy. We were a bit skeptical but bought to check it out. Wow! are we impressed! We tell it to turn on and turn off our lights in the living room, family room, and bedroom. Also it can dim the lights more than once. Need the local weather forecast, just ask. Want to listen to Christmas music? Yes, again. Want to know the distance to someplace or the population of some city or country, yes! We\\'re still discovering what it can do and it seems limitless. Absolutely love this!! This does not give great answers and the connection is not that great. Exchanging for a GOOGLE Home We all love ALEXA! You can play games like Jeopardy or would you rather family edition. The kids love to have Alexa tell them jokes. Alexa Exceed expectations in it ability to control I\\'ve had an Amazon Echo and Dot for over a year now. I really wanted to develop the Smart Device usage around my house and when the upgraded Echo i just had to have it. It is a great device. I use the drop in feature to communicate with others in the house, especially when they are upstairs, without having to yell. The smart hub is amazing. Attaching to smart devices is much more seamless than with the 1st gen echo. Just got it so time will tell, but the 2nd gen Echo devices are worth it. Works great with WeMo and Philips Hue. Great sound and voice recognition. Loud speaker, very responsive. Makes it easier that the smart hub is built into it than having to buy another piece of equipment. Very easy to set up. I mostly control the lights with my Hue cell phone app. Very convenient. I have 4 lamps hooked up to the light bulbs now. I plan on doing most of my house in the future. I listen to music and get weather updates from the Echo. My husband uses the echo as an alarm. We the concept to learn and adapt to the ever changing word. This product should stand out. I love that I have the ability to catch up on news and have this crazy thing turn on and off my lights. Love it!! It has very good voice recognition; even with the grandchildren throwing all kinds of crazy questions at it. Speaker quality is top of the line. Everyone that has tried it out at our house loves it. The Echo is a great addition for my busy household. The voice commands to play music is excellent. The fact I can sit on my couch and control the lights and other items just by saying what i want is just amazing. I love Alexa! Great sound, unlimited music, used the bulb and synchronized it...Simple 2 use.... Very easy to setup. Had no issues at all . Nice having hub inside . Bulb sync was a breeze I bought this and an Echo Dot just in case the Dot didn\\'t do everything I needed. The Dot worked fine, so I returned the full-featured Echo Plus. Upgraded to the Plus with a lot of the accessories. We returned it. Could not give answers to our questions even though the answers were easily found on google. This is a great entry level Alexa product. The speaker is adequate, but the inclusion of the Philip‚Äôs hue bulb makes it feel like a good deal This was an awesome gift for someone very special and they enjoy it as much as I do mine would recommend product You are able to control you lights and other electrical devices with the Echo Plus I truly love this item ,its amszing good . Will do This Alex\\'s device is fantastic and would recommend it for anyone. Especially for people with physical disabilities. We are enjoying all of its features. Had the Echo Plus over a week and this thing is amazing. Great sound and easy to move around. A little tricky with the set up but works great. Easy set up and very user friendly for my children My DIL loves it. Does everything she had read about. My grandson is a bit disappointed that Alexa can\\'t carry on a conversation. LOL. However, he is only 8. Purchased this for my wife. All the lights are now voice activated. The sound it great from the built in speaker. awesome product my wife and I love it makes home automation simple We finally decided to try the Echo system, after months and months of debate. We purchased the Echo Plus & an Echo Dot. The Plus easily handles our main two floors and the Dot handles our upstairs. The Plus\\'s speakers are incredible for its size. We both agree we made the right choice to get the Plus. I bought this for my brother and his wife. They love it! Not only does it control their Nest thermostat, it works with their expanding environment of Philips Hue bulbs. works like a dream.use it daily.phone feature is really cool.like it. Smart Home=Happy Home!This lightbulb is simple...all you need to do is speak to it A perfect gift for someone who has everything and a busy schedule Purchased the product for a gift. Has not been used yet We have two echo ourselves and purchased this as a gift for someone. We have smart plugs for our lamps that Alexa turns on/off. It made a great Christmas present for my wife. Plus...I get it too...Works great. Great order and delivery from Best Buy. Great item for controling your lights in my home even when I\\'m away. This is our first Echo so nothing to compare it to, but so far so good! Sound is great. Fun to use and has been helpful for information needed quickly! The echo is great for choosing music and getting information. The voice is very soothing. Easy to set up. Performs well. Nice Product For The Money Bought this Echo for my wife. She loves how just by speaking she can listen to any type of music. It sounds pretty good too. I purchased my Eco for the holidays. It took me considerable time to get minimally operational. It is rather complex to hook up to other devises. So far it is only hooked up to my Dot. I wish there were more varieties of ways to learn how to use it. I am not nearly able to make use of it yet. But...it does look exciting if I ever get there. The built in hue allows the echo plus to automatically search and finds connectable devices. The larger speaker area assists in better sound and the alexa to hear my voice!! I love Alexa...She has become my best friend. Thanks Kind of hard adding smart items but when you do it‚Äôs nice to just talk and not get on computer or smart phone to control I really enjoy the sound. It sounds so full. My only disappointment is the limited functionality of the built in hub. I had to purchase the Hue Hub to get full functionality. Other than that, I love it. Great Christmas gift! The hubby loved it . Just read the manual before setting up!! It\\'s awesome. Feels like \"company.\" Takes commands on the first try and the sound fills the room beautifully! My guests love it too! No complaints easy and extremely fun to use. Alexa can do it all Bought an echo plus and it has been better than I expected. Primarily use it for music in the LR but we are starting to use it for other functions such as the weather and playing jeopardy. Love this combination package I got while on sale. Amazon Echo Plus is responsive and easy to use. Great sound quality. Easy to integrate with other services such as the Hue Bulb. Just need to get more bulbs to complete my setup. I like being able to turn on lights, music and the thermostat in our home! Alexa is awesome to have at home makes things fun and easy I have an Amazon Prime account so I started downloading apps and playing all kinds of music on this. I also can control my Hue hub (you need one for certain timers and things) and Wemo plus outlets for my non wifi lights and LED\\'s in the kitchen cabinets. I bought this for my Mom for Christmas and ended up she got me one too! Great for everyone, speaker sounds great easy to set up and my Mom ended up getting the dot so she could have her light turned on from downstairs and then tell Alexa to turn it off while in bed. No regrets on this one! I gave the Echo 5 stars but I like Amazon products and ultimately the product is good..however, I use Cree smart light bulbs in my house and bought this Echo for the built in Hub to try and eliminate the extra hub space in my house..but the built in hub of the Echo Plus isn‚Äôt compatible at this time with Cree light bulbs..so I had to return it and wait for now and stick with my regular Echo and Echo Dot‚Äôs. Love the echo plus. Easy to set up with comparable extras, has simplified so many things in my home. Takes some getting to use to but patience and practice and males all the difference. The first one was not working so we had to take it back and get a new one Great product. Didnt realize it‚Äôs compatible with different items We use Alexa for so many things. We use it for shopping list, music, lights on or off, even Trivia games. Christmas gift for my son and my husband. Can‚Äôt wait to hook it up Works great and we like like the light that came with it., Not one issues so far! My wife and I love the Amazon echo plus it‚Äôs very easy to control the hue lights in the house that we have set up I would recommend this to anybody we love it. We also play a lot of music on it. We never received the light bulb. Very happy with Alexa just not happy that the bulb was not sent. It has very limited use without adding on expensive Apps or adding more wireless speakers. I am considering returning the merchandise Bought this for my son and one for my husband and me. So easy to set up. Very helpful. Doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of space. When I used to think of amazon echo I think flimsy sounds, Amazon Echo was more of ECHO-Ing, tin can complex... at least from what I have experienced with my friends echos. Echo Plus you ask... Not so much!!! This device has such excellent sound!! One of the best devices I have ever purchased! If I could I would have these all over my house. Forget the dot and the echo 2nd gen. Echo plus is the way to go!!! Beautiful device, sounds is second to none! Went to my local Best Buy and a friendly employee greed me and ask me if I needed any help, I ask about the echo and the google assistance and the employee explained the pros and cons of each device and even show me other ones. With his help I end up pickin the new echo Plus (Alexa) and I absolutely LOVE IT! I really like the Phillips Hue Bulb included and I am definitely going to buy more! My customer experience was really great and I am very grateful for the courtesy, knowledge and the time this employee offered me. This experience make me want to come back to this same store for all my needs specially because they can help me choose wisely. Love my Alexa, and love the hue bulb. Now I will be going to buy a new smart tv to control with Alexa next. Great customer service!!! Thank you!! Purchased the Echo Plus after reading that the new generation had been upgraded by improving the sound and integration of a controller. For the price provided, I thought that the deal was a good value. I have the first generation unit as well. A quick comparison of the two from a sound, look, etc perspective really didn\\'t lead me to think that there was any noticeable sound improvement nor improved aesthetics. At least the price for the unit has come down quite a bit and the addition of Philips bulb for \\'free\\' was a smart move.Overall, I think that the unit is a good purchase for beginning some home automation projects. I was really reluctant buying Alexa but I‚Äôve read so much about this item that I bought the package (Alexa and Phillips bulb) and have been amazed with how well it works. Worked right out of the box easy set up and operation Love the thing. My wife uses it daily. Should have bought it a long time ago. It even controls our Hue lights. Purchased the echo after hearing it at a neighbors. Good quality speaker for the small size. The system is able to react quickly to the verbal directions. It even is able to pickup voices across the room and seems to capture the commands accurately even when spoken quickly. Got one for my daughter last year and she loves it. I had 3 dots and decided to get the echo plus. Great product so far. Controls my hue lights. Grandkids love asking it questions. Great device. Good speaker, very solid feeling. Microphones listen well. I have the Echo plus and i love it the speakers sounds loud and clear. Bought for my husband for Christmas. We keep it in our kitchen and mainly just use it for music. But our kids love that they can tell Alexa to play a song they like and it plays I really like the echo plus and the hue light bulb does work on the echo plus but I had to buy a bridge from Phillips in order to schedule on off schedule times for the light. I thought the Echo Plus was like a bridge but I guess it isn‚Äôt. One For Us One For The Kids For Christmas!Great way to get connected! This Amazon Echo is the COOLEST gadget you can buy, it is VERY SMART and learns very fast. it runs many items in our home IE Nest, LG TV, Lights The device is extremely useful for all those who choose to have a smart/connected home. The built-in hub helps you to connect your devices easier than not having it. I would recommend this device especially if you have a prime membership. This is a very neat item. Love all the things this can do! Speaker has great sound and it‚Äôs awsome that it syncs with other speakers to really fill your house with sound. The smart lights I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, but since I‚Äôve installed it I want to get more. It‚Äôs a great smarthome hub. This is my second Alexa and the second time set up so much easier. I love the extra volume for my music and the peer to peer calling gives me a mini hands free intercom. Still discovering the new features. I loved my echo so much I bought my sister one. I can now turn on my lights when I get home just by asking Alexa. Is great, fun, useful. Great speaker. Kids love it. I really like how she is able to interact and plays music with great sound. She interacts with my smart home. Got this model only because of the sale price and the built in hub that controls my hue strip lights. And....I didn‚Äôt want to say google all the time! Sounds like baby talk to me....lol Echo Plus has everything the old Echo had, plus better sound and built-in capability for Smart Home add-ons, like Hue bulbs and SmartThings plugs ‚Äî without needing a Hue hub or ST hub. Love it! I am not a tech person, but I was able to easily connect these devices to my network This was out first time using any of Amazons alexa products and we love it. So far we have the hue light bulbs and fire stick but plan on updating the front door lock and thermostat. So easy to use and convenient. Very easy to set up! Easy to connect with multiple Amazon Echo Dots, as well as multiple smart home products. Worked fine first time out of the box. Plug it in, set it up with you Amazon account and you are ready to go. It is very convenient to turn on and off the Phillips light by voice. I love being able to use Alexa. She is an amazing AI. Until the robots rebel against the human kind I think it‚Äôs worth it. this was a great purchase with one hue bulb included with the echo plus. Installation/set up was a breeze. This ia a great product, more technology to make your life easier. This works perfectly for the smart home connecting to all your devices. Coupled with Amazon prime this has it all. Voice speaker clearly understands you from up close and from across the house. Definitely recommend to anyone that wants a exciting product Alexa is fun to play with for the whole family, and it fills the house with music when not telling us a joke. Great product, easier set up than anticipated. Actually bought for my Mother - she loves it. I love amazon products, easy to use and install. I recommend them 100%. very good sound and above all price I like being able to ask about the weather, set an alarm on my phone or create a shopping list all by just asking Elexia. From her jokes, rapping and everyday new fact Alexa is awesome. Its super easy to pull out your phone to check the weather but i honestly never did and would always be surprised when i walked outside with whatever it is that day. But every morning i ask alexa whats the weather and she gives me an in depth review for that day and the rest of the week. There are tons of skills for Alexa most useful some random. But shes a must try. Also plus about the echo plus is if you want to start a smart home you dont need a hub like the other echo pieces. You can just buy some compatible smart bulbs. You need to have Amazone prime in order to have music Works great. Can‚Äôt wait to find all it can do for me. Asking trivia questions of Alexa is a hoot but being able to turn off the ceiling fan from bed is golden. Built-in hub only lets your control Philips Hue with your voice. You still need the Philips Hue hub to be able to use the Hue app. I ended up buying the Hue hub as well. Has better speaker than the regular Echo. Great product easy to use and would recommend to anyone I really like this product. My Son got us the Alexa Show for Christmas and I wanted one that would turn on lights and other items. So we purchased this because it has the bridge so that you can use it with the Phillips Hue lights. It works great. I have the Show in the kitchen and I have the Echo in my bedroom. I love that it has a great built in speaker. I can have it play my music in both rooms at the same time..... Bought for a family memeber and he was so happy with the game I purchase one for my children and us is a great way to stay connected and smart to have it at home Alexa really amazes me. She learns new skills everyday. I‚Äôm still trying to get it set up but so far it‚Äôs a blast! We like using the Echo. Probably didn\\'t need the plus because we are just using it to play music on Amazon music. I was skeptical about the Amazon Echo products. Why would I need this? I bought the Echo Dot first and was hooked. Bought this Echo Plus for smart home integration. Since then, I have bought a bunch of smart bulbs and plan on more \"things\", I bought an Echo Spot, too. You do not need an Echo product, but they are fun, practical and cool. Can\\'t live without it now! A fun little device on the cutting edge of consumer artificial intelligence. Sp aker sounds pretty good. Alexa does have some problems understanding how I ask questions a fair amount of the time. I was wishing I good set it up to my pool equipment. Excellent item... above and beyond my expectations It works great and is easy too use. The salesman was a tremendous help. I bought this for myself and another one for a gift, you must have Wi-Fi to use as well as a smart phone. Good product and wasy to set up. Works well with smart lights. This is great for inquisitive minds. Alexa plays music, turns the light on, answers questions and so much more. ECHO PLUS OFFERS SO MUCH MORE FOR THE SMART HOME., HOWEVER, I HAVE HAD THE DOT FOR A LONG TIME AND YESTERDAY I BOUGHT 5 ECHO DOTS FOR MY CHILDREN .GREAT PRODUCT. great sound. Love the music and the electrical devices you can work with it. My home is about 80% automated with help from ALEXA...We want to have one in each room. I really purchased this for my wife to use as a Bluetooth speaker knowing that maybe we would find something else for it to do. I\\'m glad I did, now. We have Christmas tree lights going off and on, lamps dimming at precise measures, \"Alexa, light 30 percent\", and am looking at the other many, many things that this can do. It\\'s easy to setup, too. Easy to set up. We really enjoy getting real time local weather. It translates Spanish very efficiently. We also enjoy the music we can easily select but would appreciate a higher quality sound. Linking the Echo to lighting is a snap. Highly recommended! LOVE it. Never had one before. Easy to set up and use. Alexa works pretty good, music sounds good. Just exploring all her skills i have really enjoyed my new echo plus.i enjoy music every morning with the news Bought this for our son for Christmas. He uses it in his room and loves it. Alexa also wakes him up for school in the morning. this is so much better than the echo dot. the smart hub is pretty cool Awesome product and cool design and a great color I would recommend to a friend I already have Alexa at home and since it was on sale, made a nice christmas gift.. It works well and sounds decent, but the hub portion of this is not as easy to use as Samsung. This was a gift that I gave to my daughter at our family Christmas party. She loves it, especially the ease of set up and the attached hub so she can control her lights & her nest thermostat. This has also gone over well with the Grand Children. Echo plus seems to work as they say. I have it running two lights so far. Plan on setting up seven more. Nice product. Alexa items are easy to use and set up. Works easily with the smart plug and bulb. This is the music lovers best friend. My wife and kids love asking Alexa to play ANY song. The sound quality is great Seamlessly control your house, tell Alexa to turn on your favorite music, and play games. Not much else you could ask for, especially for the price! I received an original echo two years ago and use it in my office. This year I decided to get one for the house and was amazed at all the features I hadn‚Äôt taken advantage of. Primarily the smart home features. This was great because it came with a lightbulb. I was a bit reluctant to jump on the Alexa wagon, but now that I have, I don‚Äôt know why! This is awesome. Still figuring out all the things I can do but only because there are so many! This will be a great gift for the whole house too enjoy. Works seamlessly and easy to set up and use. A great product. This product is so very convenient I have day I don\\'t want to get up and she helps me My kids like to play music, I like the online rafio and weather service. We love our Echo plus. Alexa is my go to girl for everything. Music sounds great in the kitchen. Great purchase. We bought this to make it easier to turn off lights, etc. It\\'s perfect for connecting the whole house. I enjoy the premium sound with this Amazon Echo Plus speaker. Of course it also connects to Alexa, so I can do everything from making calls to listening to music, and finding recipes for cooking meals.is compatible with smart home technology for hands-free control of lighting and other functions. I like the Amazon Echo Plus speaker because it adapts to my speech patterns. Sound quality is very good & Sleek design is nice. We bought this for our son who wanted nothing for christmas... he uses it all the time. With lights, music, and locking the door. He absolutely loves it. We are now buying another home base for the rest of the house. Works great used to put the lights on when I was in Texas during the holidays. A great value and I love it, sounds great and works Saw Echo dot at my parents. Had to have one. Then I saw the plus. It was so easy to set up. Love the the music steaming. Love the light bulb that came with mine. Makes my life so much easier when I don‚Äôt have an empty hand. Guess what, I went back and bought one for my sister for Christmas. Very pleased. The Echo Plus is an Awesome Device. Lots of information just by speech. Quite satisfied w/ purchase ... However, paying 50 dollars for a smart bulb has proven to be a superfluous expense ... Very helpful for someone with disabilities. Saves a lot steps.Responsive and fun to use. Best Buy associate explained product very well. Easy to use I bought this for my wife and absolutely loves it. Alexa is so smart and helps my wife with everything. Like a personal assistant Love the Alexa. Very convenient to use to listen to music and turn on my lights. Bought this for my parents to use with their Amazon prime account. Sure they will love it. Wanted to expand Alexa into multiple rooms of the house. This device added easily into the system and can now listen to music in multiple rooms. I purchase the Echo Plus as a Christmas gift but set it up early so that it could be used right out of the box. I was impressed how easy the setup was. I\\'ll find out later how it sounds and works. This is the best...fast to play music and check weather and lots of other questions Nice smart speaker. I do wish there was a LG TV Alexa skill. My new Echo Plus exceeds my expectations. The speaker\\'s sound is just what I wanted and the included Hue bulb is great. We already have the Echo in our house. I got this for my son for his apartment and he loves it. received as a Christmas gift. really works well, we can turn the living room light on and off from anywhere with cell phone, so you don\\'t need to remember to plug in a timer when going away. plays amazon music and sound is amazing I purchased it to control my lights & introduce myself to Alexa & AI, but I find myself using it for all sorts of things and enjoy using it. I can now control my front door Arlo camera by asking Alexa to show the live feed in to my TV, and get my Robots vacuum cleaner to start work , plus listen to the latest weather conditions & do my normal google search via Alexa . I am seriously hooked in to my Alexa!!!! Love it so far but I have a lot to learn yet. My son loves it also. This product is great. Still finding out everything that it can do, but completely satisfied. Would be so much better if it had an internal battery I enjoyed and I bought an echo too To make all my family take the pleasure of it Definitely worth the money. The sound is awesome!! my wife loves alexa it was an early Christmas present So far I love the echo products. I ended up buying a combination of 8 for Christmas gifts I have both a 1st gen Echo and now the new Echo Plus. I am impressed with the sound quality improvement, especially the bass. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs no Bose system but it sounds great for every day use. Very pleased. Based upon reviews I did expect the speaker to be louder and have a bit better sound but not a big deal. For big sound just turn on the stereo. My family Loves this. My 3 boys love asking alexa to tell a joke, or to make toot noises. It\\'s super helpful in with news and weather updates. Easy to set up, easy to use apps are awesome and sounds great! I absolutely love this product. It does so many things not the least of which is music. Ask it anything and it will answer. Sound is amazing! Wish Alexa knew more things I get a lot of I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt know that which is unfortunate. Purchased the Echo Plus and couldn\\'t be more pleased. Easy to use. On sale & was purchased as a gift for Christmas, really great deal! Love the concept and how I can make my whole house a smart house. Decent sounding music device...easy to connect and use the app. Getting custom routines set up with smart home (vivint, hue, etc) takes some trial and error figuring out commands. Would buy again. Really enjoy the Echo Plus, this is a must have for all homes! So far the Echo has been extreme useful. My husband just says start my day in the morning and it gives him the weather and traffic before he leaves for work. It is also is nice to tell it to turn on and off lights in the home with the smart bulbs. Overall I\\'m extremely satisfied with my Echo plus. I bought this for my 14 year old daughter and she loves it!!!! This amazon Alexa plus is awesome...it‚Äôs works great and easy to set up Love this product. I can ask questions and play music...also link my lights to it! I am so glad that I bought this Echo, it has made it easier to automate my music, and my lights throughout my house. We are still learning to use it, but hope to add our thermostat as well to the items I can control with my Alexa. Not sure. It was a gift. We\\'ll be setting up after Christmas This is the first Echo that we have used and really like it. It is easy to set up according to my husband. There are things that we would like to do but don\\'t have instructions on how to do them. Echo plus is great for home use, to ask questions and turn the lights on when you away. I am not the most tech savvy person and found this very easy to get set up without any help. It great to have in the home it has become invaluable Excellent combination and easy to install and setup. When I tried to hook it up it wouldn\\'t recognize my internet. I will have to contact best buy when I get home and have their guys come out to see if they can get it working Surprisingly entertaining, and a diverse selection of apps make for a fun addition to the house. Adding lights and enabled plugs adds to the fun and practicality as well. Set up was simple. We liked so much we bought one for my Mom Great product. I use it everyday. It‚Äôs a great way to automate your home Very happy with amazon not hesitating to integrate their products with third party integration.‚ÄùCrestron I looked at Google Home .. And the Echo. I went with the Echo after I spoke to a Best Buy employee. They helped me sort out the pros and cons. I do love all the skills that are possible. Its like another person in my apt sometimes. (I live alone) the Echo adjusts my lights and plays my Pandora. I\\'m pretty much loving it. I love my echo so easy to hook up and great sound quality It‚Äôs easily connected to my Sony android tv and works great! I didn‚Äôt know what I was missing out on until I got an Echo Plus Purchased the Echo Plus because of the built in Zigbee hub. It controls my Philips Hue bulbs throughout the house. very easy setup. Speaker is sufficient for the area I have it in. I‚Äôve been hesitant to purchase this item, didn‚Äôt feel there was an actual need. Alexa has changed my mind. I use this daily with timers and turning off appliances, checking weather and adjusting my heat. Alexa can even arm the alarm system. Great sound quality. Easy to set up. Easy to use. Looks good too. Let there be light - this has been awesome to be able to walk in to a room and with a spoken word from me have the light go on. Equally impressive is that it gradually goes bright so you aren‚Äôt blinded by it. Eco plus is an amazing product, it integrates with most of the products...U can set the music, reminders, buy products.. what not...definitely a worthy purchase!!! Setting this up was about as easy as one could expect. The Echo Plus is an amazing device and I got a free smart light bulb with a package deal. :-) You simply must have a virtual voice activated assistant. I can not recommend this product enough. If you don‚Äôt have one, you will eventually. If you can‚Äôt afford you, you aren‚Äôt a Big Baller. Easy to set up and pair other compatible items by enabling skills through the Amazon app. I\\'ve been to best buy twice for information and how to questions and all seems to be going well. It\\'s only been a week and still have a lot to learn about Elexa\\'s capabilities I love my amazon echo plus as bad as it sounds I don‚Äôt have to get out of bed to turn the lights off, my fans on or off, and even my tv. We love alexa! I really like this device! Right now I only have 1 light sync\\'d with it, but looking forward to adding more! Another feature I like is the ability to put items on both my shopping and errand lists! I can\\'t wait to find out all the things it can do for me! As a newbie in smart home technology, I was attracted to the Echo Plus because of the built-in Zigbee hub which means it can connect directly to products like the Philips Hue line of smart bulbs without the need for a separate smart hub. Combine that with the power of Alexa voice commands and I was able to get my smart home up and running in a matter of minutes. I bought this for my finance.i bought it for Christmas he left bed it Sound and response is good. Works well for area coverage. The echo plus is the way to go and with the hue, no need to install a dimmer! The echo plus has been great .easy to set up and work.its all I thought it would be and more ,love it Love operation of this system.Bought the mini afterwards for another room. I wondered about buying one before making the decision - now even after just a few weeks I wonder how I managed. It has some gimmicky things yes but also can help out with a lot of very useful ideas such as weather, traffic and lists. Would recommend one to anyone Bought eh Echo Plus on a whim - it was on sale and I figured, \"why not.\" I am really enjoying it. Apart form the basic news and weather reporting, I enjoy my morning trivia. I also use the music from Amazon a lot. It\\'s been nice having a \"holiday\" station at my disposal. The Echo Plus is easy to set up and use and definitely has a lot of features, many of which I am still learning. Love this product, super easy to use and able to have a lot of fun with this with entertaining guests and ourselves. It has great speakers and is very easy to set up love my echo Bought this for my mom that is electronically challenged and she loves it. Makes her feel like she is a tech wiz. Makes me feel better about her ability to turn lights on and off as she comes and goes. More importantly, she is in her 70s and Iives alone, she can make a phone call using Alexa from anywhere she has an echo. I bought her 3 to cover her whole house. This means if she falls down and can‚Äôt get to her phone she can dial me or 911 with her voice.....a must have!!! Still figuring out what all I can do with it but the Echo was extremely easy to hook up. The instructions that came with it made everything very clear. The speaker doesnt get room filling loud if you want to play music but thankfully it has an audio out jack so I just hooked it up to some speakers. Surprisingly useful. Ben 2 Echo is much better than Gen 1. Definitely recommend. We love the new Echo! So easy to set up and use!!! Alexa usually works well but it has turned on things when I did not tell it to. its a lot of fun playing with alexa comands the speakers sound great. i\\'m glad i purchase it. I love this product would really recommend to any one! Love being able to set a timer, play music and turn in my Wi-Fi connected lamp without moving from my couch. This has got to be the best electronic purchase I‚Äôve made in recent months! Easy to set up, so many skills to enable, Alexa knows it all! The range is about 30 feet for it to hear and recognize my voice. Be sure to speak clearly. Great purchase, and exceeds my expectations. Works great with my iOS devices too! This may be an incremental upgrade to the original Amazon Echo but is definitely worth it. Miles ahead from Google Home. As I made my home a smart home I know I know I made a smart choice with Amazon Echo and Philips light bulbs. I\\'m looking forward to adding more smart gadgets to my collection. The light came free with the Echo (didn‚Äôt know) but now that I have that one I want to get all my lights like this one! It‚Äôs so great and convenient to be able to tell it to turn off right before I leave the room instead of having to walk over there to pull the cord. Or even better when you forget to turn the switch off before you sit down, that‚Äôs the worst! Love asking Alexis all kinds of questions and listening to great Amazon Music!!!! Very easy to set up.Changed how I do a lot of things. Pretty cool product.Features are limited unless you spend a lot more money buying other things you can connect and interface with. But the basic unit with one lightbulb is a pretty good start. Just know going into it that you will be shelling out a lot more to expand the system. The sound of the Echo Plus is good, and the matte black color looks stylish. The Phillips Hugh Bulb that was included with my purchase is nice and convenient. Purchased as a gift for my 14 year old son. He absolutely loves it. Uses to place music, ask questions and turn off his lights! Still learning what all she can do but it definitely makes life easier. She could perform some tasks ,but most things she didn\\'t know. So agrivating. We love the Echo II. Its an awesome product. Great price too My husband loves the ability to listen to anything and to be able to run the living room light when he comes in instead of trying to find the light switch. I have been greatly impressed with the Alexa. A friend loves calling me and asking her Alexa questions. We share alot of laughs just discovering all the things she can do. So I just had to purchase an Alexa for myself. I\\'m just beginning set my Alexa up. I hope it\\'s easy because I\\'m not tech. salve. I\\'ve got to go and get started with the set-up. I mainly bought the Echo plus for my kids but I‚Äôm using it more than they do. Excellent product!! I purchased this, in addition to several other Alexa products, because I wanted the hub to connect several smart home devices. So far it has been pretty easy to set up and use. I\\'m happy with the sound also. As advertised. Easy set up and integration. Haven\\'t tried to use the hub yet but it is limited in the number of products it works with compared to Samsung Smartthing or Wink 2. Love the bigger speaker and the quality of sound with this product. Like turning on bedroom light with Alexa. I usually unplug it but when I plug it back in, it is always difficult to get it reconnected to the internet for some reason. I purchased this to pair with my other echo while I enjoy my other 2 echoes I must say there is a noticeably difference with the echo plus and best buy had it at a remarkable price better than amazon so it was win they amped up the speaker like the Alexa but needs to be more interactive like suri. Enjoying using Alexa.... and love the smart home features. Fun item and helpful to do things around the home. I have not had a chance to use the HUB function on this device, but it was easy to set up and get running, still learning how to make it work with the other echo devices, but overall it operates as advertised. It is nice to say one set of key words, and it kicks off a whole series of events. (Turn lights on, play music etc). I‚Äôm a big Apple consumer all around but after tons of research and testing, I went to alexa over Siri (Apple home kit) to make my full home a smart house. Like the idea of having a built-in hub to control other smart home devices as we get them.Sound quality is marginally better, but we didn\\'t buy Echos as audiophiles...but for background music and it\\'s perfect for that.My only complaint to date is that we have to accounts in our home and Amazon Echo must have one or the other. That makes it frustrating for the other user (particularly when playing configuring music to play in all rooms). I love my Echo so much. I have my lights and front door deadbolt hooked up to it. I play music from it all the time and ask Alexa about the traffic and weather. I would recommend the Echo to everyone. Echo plus is able to play music and response whatever answer by itself. It also equip with bluetooth so I can pair to another more powerful speaker. It\\'s so convenient to ask/request without touch anything. The response time is acceptable but you need to speak out your question right after calling Alex or it won\\'t wait. Great product. Loving alexa! Was so happy with it that know its a big part of all that i do. My wife and I enjoy using Alexa for weather information and also for the great music that we are able to access. We also have the light under the control of Alexa so that we never have to walk into a dark house again. Has built in smart hub unlike other echos. Works with other smart home devices with no additional purchases. Needs some improvements on being able to answer questions, but all in all its great and the sound is stellar Great price, large selection. Plenty to choose from! I love all of the things you can do with the Echo. I am still learning everything I can do and look forward to more content going forward. New version is much better, Integrated Hub works great and response time is better than previous. Upgraded to this one from older version. Responsive. Bought as a Christmas gift. Works good with no problems Our entire family loves Alexa and the white color looks great on our kitchen counters. Very easy to use distance is sometime an issue for Alexa hearing at times Love listening to music and having it turn my light on and off No issues perfect works as advertised........................ Perfect item for any place in your house. Love the speaker and the different features it does. It‚Äôs the greats Idea for your home lighting in your home or business Great product. Works well and is even easy for kids to use It is a great buy. The sound is great quality. Deliveres what I need for a comfortable house We got this for the whole family and we are absolutely love the Alexa speaker Love that I can control my lights with the Phillips bulbs and is compatible with smart plugs to control other electronics in the house. Definitely would recommend I would recommend this to anyone who like to speak commands to technology and have it respond. I purchased this for my husband who is sick and he can ask for weather, music, sport events and more. Great item! Very handy to get the morning news as well as asking him to play music. I‚Äôve been using the Amazon Echo from the day it was released to the market. Unfortunately the volume control wheel broke. I quickly went over to my local best buy and purchased the next generation. There are amazing improvements concerning this device. I Really And Truly Are In Love With Alexa. I don‚Äôt know what I would do without her Great sound and voice recognition, easy to set up and fun to use. I m so happy to get this amazon echo plus. Great to have it. I was reluctant to purchase the Echo Plus and my best friend said to do it, you will love it! I did and she was so right! The Philips Hue light bulb was an added bonus and love that too! I never thought that buying this product was such a great step up. Really makes watching a movie and turning on the TV so easy, really works well with my harmony hub. Love the way I can control all the lights. Looking forward to all the add ons, I can purchase. I love this. Has great sound. I thought i bought in silver. THe packaging was a little deceptive. But I\\'m loving it. Wanting to get a second one. makes things easy to control. connects to other products It‚Äôs my first Alexa and I love it nice sound and smart light acts fast with command I love Alexa. Has a pretty good speaker for listening toMusic and helps with my shopping lists. Nice addition to the home but not essential; would recommend as a gift and although I like t I could definitely live without it Product works well, and is fun to use. I did a fair amount of research trying to decide between this product and Google\\'s, and the reviews tend to favor the Echo. I have no complaints. I love it, the sound is great. I use it everyday for my dogs to listen to when I am at work. I have an original Gen 1 Echo that has been relocated to My Bedroom by simply unplugging and Plugging back in!Now that I have the Gen 2 Echo Plus in my Living Room and set up to work seamlessly with my Gen 1 I could not be happier. Along with the built in Hue it makes it that much better. Everything works just like I want and the sound on both devices are perfect for me. this is my first experience with Alexa. hard to command, I guess because this is my first time. I did have to reset because she stopped working. I am reading up on Alexa more so I‚Äôll know how to command her. This purchase is replacing an echo for that is being moved to a bedroom. The sound is far superior to the dot (which has decent sound). The echos just keep getting better and more useful. To use. Putting in after Christmas. Want all lights on voice activation. This is great. It\\'s a lot of fun and much better than I expected The whole family uses the ECHO we love the ability to use just say Alexa and tell here what we want. The youngest granddaughter loves the insult generator! I love my Amazon Echo! Alexa is compatible with all of my technology and super easy to use. My favorite is the ease of making a grocery list and having it in the app instead of forgetting my list at home. Great little speaker I use it every day and I have it about for three days already Added Alexa hub and expanded the lighting capabilities. Easy setup and it works like a charm. Looking for more devices to add to the mix! Alexa is the greatest device to have around the house. She basically runs my house for me I purchase this at the store and I was not given any bulb till I decide to do review Got this for my Dad for Christmas. Awesome gift, he was super excited!! Having fun with all the things we can learn from Alexa! It is almost like having another person in the house! Extra features don‚Äôt really seem worth it. I would just buy the basic one instead The only thing I would say is that you have to do a work around for Direct TV, other that that it is great! So much fun, love it........................................................... I‚Äôm pretty impressed with the technology. It‚Äôs a little annoying having to say Alexa all the time. I‚Äôve purchases the links for the outlets and that‚Äôs all it‚Äôs really good for since the bulbs were too dim for me. Bought for mother, she loves it! Good price, in stock, and an easy purchase. Returned product cause I did not like it and really had no use for it Works well, and the speakers decent! Sounds much better than the 2nd generation of the Echo. The Alexa works well and turns my lights on and off for me in bed, and plays my playlist for when I sleep. Very nice for the bedroom. Use it in bathroom to listen to my amazon music and with Alexa you can control it with just your voice We love it! The whole family likes to ask questions. Still learning and figuring out all it can do for me! Making our home smart and adding Echo has been great! So convenient! I purchased two echo dots for Black Friday, once I loaded my XM I found the shortcomings. The volume was not load enough. Went back and picked this up and it filled up the room. The dot was moved to the bedroom were it was load enough for the small room. This is the hub dollar my smart devices and it worksThis is the hub dollar my smart devices and it works Have just started using Alexa and am looking forward to all the other things that are available to use with the unit i was weary about it at first but it was easy to setup and get the hang of and definitely makes life easier! The amazon echo plus has worked great. We like the smart bulb with the echo. We are so happy with our Alexa! We are very technologically challenged but she‚Äôs been great! Already have the echo and dot. Has good sound quality and with the hub feature you can control the hue lights with Alexa which is convenient when walking in the house with a bunch of groceries. Very easy to set up. Adding other accessories that it operates is easy as well. Great product. Friend received Amazon Echo as gift & is enjoying it. I researched & decided on Echo Plus as I wanted capability to use to control home lighting. Absolutely love this product! It controls lights in several rooms as well as outdoor lighting. Other features, weather, news briefs, traffic are fun, but the lighting control did it for me. Amazon and Philips Hue work great together. very easy setup. The only drawback is using these bulbs on a non-Philips dimmer switch. The bulbs flicker a bit, even when it\\'s set to full on This is a neat little toy. It‚Äôs pretty cool that I‚Äôm able to turn the lights on and off, by talking to Alexa. Kinda bummed didn‚Äôt realize I bought the package and didn‚Äôt get my extra Phillips hue bulb. But I love the echo plus with the hub! Great product. Just annoyed that the sales guy at Best Buy didn‚Äôt make sure I knew I also got a free bulb with my purchase. If you want to control your light, tv..ect with just your voice Alexa can do that and much more I have had this for around a month and i love it. It makes it simple to set timers and control my lights I use Alexa for a alarm clock, turning on lights when I get home and I love listening to any genre of music!! The speaker is loud enough to cover my room but I still connect external speakers. The hub portion of the device works well, although I wish it had more capabilities when it comes to controlling hue lighting. super cool very interesting i have a lot of fun with it I bought the echo plus that is supposed to come with a Phillips Hue light bulb. I got the echo plus but no light bulb. I contacted Elite Plus and after a very long go around was told I would get a $20 credit on the best buy gift card that I used as part of the payment. I was told it would take up to 15 days to get the credit (why so long). I was also told I would get an email stating info about the credit. I still have not gotten the email. I have my doubts if I will ever see the $20 put back on my gift card. This is the second time I have ordered a bundle from Best Buy online and have received the main item but not the bundled items. Last year I bought a friend a PS4 bundle for XMas. They got the PS4 but none of the included games. I had to call and get the games sent out separately. I don\\'t know what is the problem is with their online ordering when bundled items are included. I am getting very wary of ordering anything online with Best Buy that I will get what I ordered on time. BTW... I really like the Echo Plus. Just not the screw up with the shipping and the initial solution I was offered when I called customer service. This works well as it was a gift and connected without issue along with the other two. Great product, answers all your questions and controls compatible devices Works great! I am looking forward to purchase more for the diffrent rooms in my house. I enjoy my new smart speaker. It is a good device that I can get my pandora radio on it, especially in the app. Learning what the device offers for smart home, besides that. It is good speaker to work with different apps. This is a must, excellent technology. Great design and sleek looks. I am very happy with unit. This thing works great! I would recommend to all of my friends. Should have bought one sooner. We listen to music non stop now. This doesn\\'t require separate speakers and has great sound Love this thing ! I have linked it to my Hue System and my Fire TV. I ask her and she does it. Fun to play games also. My wife was sceptical but now she uses it more than me I like the looks of the Echo Plus and the sound from the speakers is something I didn‚Äôt expect to be as nice as it is. I‚Äôm using it to tune into my favorite radio station, answer any question I have to look up on the internet and assist me with lighting. I am considering another for a different room. My son loves it. He now wants to add more for Alexa to use. I like it for controlling my lights. I like that we can play anyone\\'s music playlist. Awesome love them had to buy 2 more for the family I love our Amazon echo plus! My boyfriend says this was the best present for Christmas. daily. We bought this and it‚Äôs a cool tool/toy to play with. We have it hook up to the lights and our appliances. Now that now how to set it up I love my alexia lights Unable to try light bulb because it would not hook to echo plus.Waiting for rest of system. Easy to use. Should have bought this a long time ago. The whole family has so much fun with this, we all just ask questions just to hear her give us answers haha This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my wife so I haven\\'t used it yet. We do have several echo dots and we love those. With it coming with hue light bulb that\\'s an added bonus Well, I bought this on a lark. And to my surprise, I\\'m using it all day long to get the news alerts, check the weather, and listen to music. Works well, and even understands my relatively heavy southern accent. I went into the store looking for a Bluetooth speaker for music and left with this. Works great and sounds good. nice and compact, great sound, easy to use, love it. Love this bot and lighting system. It transforms my house into many moods. Planning to get more lights and maybe another bot. Love having the Echo to get quick weather reports, play music, and other helpful information. I have several home automation devices and the Echo Plus controls all of them. I was so happy with automation, I bought an Echo Dot and Echo Tap. having an assistant like Echo makes life so much easier Love how it hooks up to lights. And can play any music Alexa is easily confused and fun to mess with but also informative when we are being serious. She disappoints when she loses connection with the wifi; but it\\'s not often. We have 6 different Alexa products and after a few hiccups; all are working well. Impressed. First time user of the Alexa plus. Using it more and more every day. Love it We had heard a lot about the Echo Plus and had seen the commercials. We have not been disappointed as Alexa is a welcomed family member already !!! We Love Her !!! Love the light. It\\'s very handy to use. Have them in multiple rooms It works pretty well. I wish there\\'s was an instruction book with it instead of having to go online. Plus I didn\\'t know you had to pay for music and it doesn\\'t listen very well like it said it would. Purchased Alexa Echo Plus instead of bridge for smart home. Alexa is great!! Smart home setup was easy. This is one of Good item bought for my 2017 Thanksgiving deals I wanted to try out this technology. It is cool. Sometimes, I would prefer not to hear Alexa\\'s reply when I ask her to turn the light on. I love being able to turn my lights on or off by voice. It makes life a lot easier. I am looking forward to finish making my home a smart home by buying other products. Solid Amazon Echo, love they have added Phillips Hub into the product so you do not need a hub. Voice response is a little touchy compared to other Echos. My son had one and whole family enjoys so bought one for my Daughter for Christmas I love my Echo Plus!! The hub makes it easy to add devices to my Smarthome and Alexa is a great addition!! It was bought as a Christmas gift so therefore no review. Great gifts! I have the Alexa dot in each room now this is better, with the speaker base, ask Alexa to play music, find me recipes, read the news. Got this & few other dot devices to give for Xmas Easy hook up, great for lights and my Sony tv. I use all the time. I bought this for controlling most of my Smart device. No need for Philips hue bridge, I still purchased bridge as I use multiple Echo dots as well. My family love Alexa and so happy not having to buy any CD or another radio again. The Echo and the plus are great for people not wanting to run wires. And the waterpik was all we wanted I love this product just wish it was as smart as the Google home. It is very convenient and fun. voice comands are easy to use. It plays the music you want and even reads my kindle while I cook. No problem other than setup took a few minutes to finish!! Got it as a Christmas gift and I love it! I would recommend this product. The Echo Plus is a fantastically easy to use smarthome hub. It is easy to setup, fast and responsive, has a ton of capabilities that are expanding daily, and looks and sounds great. I currently use mine to manage my smart ‚Äúthings‚Äù like light bulbs, lamps, smart switches, and even my robot vac. It has made automating a lot of what I do daily a breeze and has simplified my life where I didn‚Äôt know it needed to be simplified!Definitely worth the extra money to go with the Plus over the Echo or the Dot. i have really enjoyed learning about the product and its many uses. i thought initially music, but now to get weather updates, news, receipies, sports scores, and ordering kitchen supplies. Works great! Just the beginning of my plans for a smart house! Too difficult to setup not compatible with other equipment love the sound of the Echo PlusIt sounds like a stero Love how loud it get. Shes prefect for everything I need. We love it, I find new things to do with it every day, Added another echo to the family. This one came with a free Philips HUE bulb on black friday which was great Alexa makes my life easy by turning my lights on and off, playing my favorite music and so much more! It really can control anything! We know that our grandchridren are going to love themWe love ours This is a pretty good all-in-one starter for a smart Home set up. It‚Äôs fully functional and doesn‚Äôt require a separate hub purchase for other smart Home devises. This smart bulb works with Amazon echo Plus. It can be turned on and off and also dimmed. The echo Plus is amazing - can play music, control TV and answer many questions. The Echo Plus is great. ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù is the best feature. The only problem is, you can‚Äôt use it wirelessly. It must remain plugged in at all times, which is kind of annoying. Great improved sound and built in smart hub is so useful. i purchased this to go along with my smart lights. it links up right away. i am satasified with this purchase. WORTH IT I LOVED WELL INVESTED MONEY. ALEXA HELPING ME A LOT, REMINDERS, LISTEN TO MUSIC AND MAKING MY HOUSE SMARTER, SIMPLY AND EASY, NO REGRETS:-) I absolutely love Alexa! This device is loud, easy to install, and does exactly what I tell her to do. IFeel confident purchasing products from Best Buy due to protection coverage I bought this along with the dot and it‚Äôs helpful to use as an intercom WOW THIS IS SO MUCH FUN. WOW IT CAN TELL YOU ANYTHING,PLAY ANY SONG AND MUCH MUCH MORE. We love this whole system!!! Easy to use and very useful! This product works great. I really enjoy having Alexa follow commands Other similar devices do not have the voice recognition learning capability the echo plus has. It is superior to all the others. I brought the Echo Plus for the louder sound quality. I already have an Echo Dot which I use in my bedroom to control my lights and heater via a Wemo Smart Switch. I brought the Echo Plus which I use in my family room for music and to control my smart devices. HUB is almost useless. Ended up using spare Philips HUB. The HUB built in would only \"discover\" 2 out of 12 bulbs. 3 days of trying. HUE bridge 12 out of 12 first try. Love this device, performs perfectly! Plays music and lures lights off and on by command. love all the fun things you can do with Alexa. And she\\'s learning more everyday! Bought this for my parents\\' home and it\\'s awesome. The quality of the sound is amazing. It\\'s also helpful to get quick questions answered when they\\'re running around or out of the house. I need to now purchase one for my own apartment. Also great when hosting guests. Can not tell you the price of merchandise when asked. It is nice to have access to the features this offers. I know this makes us lazy. But comes in handy when your hands are tied up with groceries or holding a baby. Love that my kids ask her questions. Purchased for son for xmas after experiencing the one at my other sons home. So many things you can use it for! Love working my lights. Bought 2 as Cristmas presents for my nephews. Both, ages 10-13 had them up and running within 20 minutes. Had fun asking questions and adjusting the Philips light bulb to different brightness levels. All in all it was a hit. Exchanged the google Google home for this model. Fun for the kids. Finding new uses for it every day. Had a problem when best buy forgot to include the free light bulb. The speaker is an improvement over the Echo Dot, set up was easy and connecting additional home automation products to it as we acquire them has been a simple process. Works as advertised! Have not really had a need for the HUB part yet though. Love the sound I am able to plug in a lamp in a hard to reach spot since it is now voice activated! This product is amazing! I wasn\\'t quite sure why everyone was going on and on about having one, but now that it\\'s in my house I cannot imagine life without it. Alexa not only answers my questions and gives me valuable information, but now she controls the lights of my house for me! I highly recommend this! I have the original Echo and just purchase the Echo Plus. Better speakers and can act as a hub for the Philips Hue Bulbs without having to purchase another hub. Very satisfied with its performance. Easy setup. They are adding new commands every week it seems. Still has some work till it is fully functional. They make it seem like you can pretty much ask anything to Alexa but she never knows anything. It is very non responsive at times too. It‚Äôs fun for the family to play with, but it may get boring after the newness wears off. We‚Äôll see. My first Alexa product and I‚Äôm going to say I‚Äôve had her for about a month and I love it have it hooked up with my Phillips hue lights works awesome Great and fun , almost like having someone in the room with you I love the Alexa. It has encouraged me to automate my home. Now I have lighting that comes on when I ask, My heat is controlled wherever I am and it\\'s fun asking her (Alexa) questions. She\\'s becoming part of the family, but, the Echo Plus is not much different (that I have discovered, yet, anyway) than the Echo 2nd generation. I haven\\'t had the Echo 1st generation and so I do not know. I have had the Echos (Plus, Echos-2nd generation, and Dot) about 3 weeks and the only thing I think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality, but, we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume. The Hue lightbulbs are great. I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus, further. I liked it so much I went back and bought the pack of Hue bulbs that were also on sale. We are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs. Love it along with the Fire Stick works great. Works great with the voice Alexa in itself needs lots of improvement but with philips hue and smart plugs you can have a lot of fun settings Alexa rocks. The Echo Plus is super easy to set up. I works great. Love everything about it. Adding more devices. we bought this as a gift for our son. he is absolutely loving it. This is a great way to begin making your home a smart home. Easy to set up, built in hub, easy to use. I needed a second charger (for traveling) for my Kindle Fire that was a fast charger. This worked great. It charges my Kindle fire in just a few hours. This solved the problem of my daughter\\'s lost kindle charger. I found that I was immediately sked by a staff member if I needed help. I received good advice and shown similar alternative products. What I bought was perfect for what I wanted. The price was quite reasonable. Best kindle charger ever. Took 30 minutes to being my kindle back to life. I was looking everywhere for this because I lost my charger for my fire stick and i finally found it at best buy. It was a great price and works perfectly! Great product for quickly charging your Kindle!!!! I bought this because the package said it was a fast charger only to find it charges at normal speed... That was disappointing. I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m not doing anything wrong. It seems pretty self explanatory... :/ Tried different charging blocks, nothing worked properly. Plugged in the Amazon block, Kindle came right up. Quickly charges kindle so son can use it. Worked great right out of the package just bought. seems to be working great so far. not sure how long it will last. Good one and working without any issues. Slim and portable This works well, charges book readers quickly and easily Love it. Best charger I ever bought. Quickly charges my Kindle and my cell phone. Have been using this item and it seems to be working quite well. After purchasing 2 different \"brand X\" charges at a lower cost, and having both of them fail after a couple weeks of use, I purchased this OEM charger (made by Amazon) for our Kindle Fire. Not only does it work well (continuously) but it fully charges the unit in a matter of 2 hours, instead of overnight charging being required. Still works great, and well worth the few dollars extra in price! Works great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! got this for my kindle 7 tablet . Does an excellent job charging the kindle fire 7 a lot faster than the one it came with the kindle fire Love this base for charging my kindle. You still need to use a good cord for most effective charge. With a good cord and this base your kindle will charge in under 30 minutes. Exactly what I needed. Didn\\'t want to settle for a generic off brand charger. Thanks to Best Buy I didn\\'t have to. Bought this charger for the Kindle voyage and its great. Purchased, took home, attached to cable,plugged in. Easy to use. No problems using this charger.'"

              "'I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm I think it is too small to read on it not very comfortable as regular Kindle Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach Didnt know how much id use a kindle so went for the lower end im happy with it even if its a little dark I am 100 happy with my purchase I caught it on sale at a really good price I am normally a real book person but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages The Kindle prevents that its extremely portable it fits better in my purse than a giant book and I have it loaded with lots of books I finish one and start another without having to go store It serves all my needs I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasnt backlit A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue This is my second Kindle the first being the old Keyboard model which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard Lol and it most likely wont be my last Solid entry level Kindle Great for kids Gifted for a kid of my friend and they love to use it to read more than their iPads battery is good but higher model is a bit better This make an excellent ebook reader Dont expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks The good thing is its cheap and good to read in the sun I ordered this for my daughter as I have the black paperwhite and I love it I read quite a bit and the larger books were driving me crazy having to hold them up while laying down or wanting to take a book on vacation and lugging around a thick paperback with this I can throw it in my bag and read anywhere Its light weight easy to use the battery life lasts for weeks which makes it an all around awesome device My daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for EReaders so she can now download books for free from school You can also download your own public library app if your county offers that and read free from there as well You can shop for ebooks straight from the device through Amazoncom I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge amazon kindle is always the best ebook upgrade every new model Its beyond my expectation and it can even show music score Not fast turning though If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item youre looking for It really is lightweight and highly functional The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments Overall an excellent buy Love my kindle makes reading at night so easy and it feels like you are reading a real book Good product for child Who only need to read the books This Kindle is a convenient size yet lettering is easy to read I use this every day on my commute Great battery life no backlight but very readable with normal lighting I like the built in dictionary Email yourself pdf or mobi files for easy transfers It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter There are times that its difficult to read because screen is not too bright Great product for myself And I bought it when there was great deal on it Item work well and was easy to read from in day light Great product and service will refer to a friend And the sales man r good Everything is great except that i cant read external pdfs properly Either it zooms too much of too little For kindle books it provides great experience Battery life is awesome I was looking for a kindle whitepaper I saw online for 80 What a deal I ordered it on line and picked it up in the store I got it home and couldnt adjust the brightness After a lengthy time with online customer service I called customer service After 20 minuets with speaking to a female Elmer Fud that doesnt speak english well I figured I would just return it Although it looks Identical to the 120 model you can not adjust the brightness That would have been good information before I bought it This is a nice barebones reading device Easy to set up and use My greatest issue is that it isnt back lit so it cant be used wo a light on in the room Returning it an purchasing a paperwhite instead Easy to use and navigate purchasing books is fast and simple and I love the fact that I can password protect this device The Amazon Kindle is light weight and easy to use I love hear readers I had to replace mine because I destroyed the last but it is awesome Love the simplicity Also love that I use it for reading only and cant download distracting apps My husband loves this Kindle He has a muscular disease keeping him from being able to handle anything with much weight at all This is perfect Ive wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when BB put it on sale I am not disappointed I have several Kindles so knew what to expect It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations I like this e reader but wish the screen were higher resolution It requires decent light to look good but it is easy on my eyes The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen which I noticed less over time The advertised month long battery life is just standby time it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books My fianc√©e really enjoyes it I would definitely recommend Simple great buy for your money if you are an avid reader I like the changes that have been made since my current 4 year old unit was purchased Fits nicely in your hand and its touchable increase the size of the fonts Great buy do a lot of reading and he no glear screen is awesome while in the sun I lie the size and weight for the kindlemakes it very convenient to take large books with me in digital format Great price and works great for book reading Would recommend Got it when it was on sale Totally fall in love with it Bring with it me everywhere I never used kindle before My wife gifted me on my birthday This is the amazing product I am using it for daily reading The display is fantastic and no strain on eyes I bought this with paper white and didn‚Äôt see much of a difference in terms of resolution and use I totally recommend this reader as it‚Äôs so small and powerful The sales people are really nice and knowledgeable to me I will come back again Im a longtime Kindle user and jumped at the opportunity to bring my granddaughter into the fold with this gift She loved it Overall good product does what is advertised comfortable to use The kindle has come in very handy lately I always have a book to read and this is great to just grab on the go Battery life is great only drawback is no backlight I am loving my new Kindle I have wanted one for a while and finally bought one and even though it was the cheapest one it has exceeded my expectations I love how there is no glare I already has an older version of the Kindle but this one is even better I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons Bought this for my 90 yearold totally notech mom Her first ebook is Gone with the Wind She likes the size and ease of use Amazon kindle products have always been reliable consistent quality and this is no different Very happy with it working well and very cheap if we think in the price way The battery doesnt last as long as was advertised if you have the money I would recommend the backlit model This Kindle doesnt have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model Its exactly what I needed nothing more nothing less Ive had no problems with the reader at all so far so Ill give it 5 stars The kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading After the first one stopped working after only 3 weeksbest Buy replaced it with no fuss and its going great Small lightweight so fits in a pursehandbag and with the antiglare screen you can read in direct sunlight I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight The Kindle is durable and although I bought a case for it a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life My son is an avid reader and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet Great item easy to usewould recommend to anybody want to use I bought this as a gift to my dad and he loves it Well worth if you dont plan on reading in dark the future of reading you just have this and it is like a whole library I bought this for my daughter wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games like with the kindle fire This latest version of the kindle is excellent I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle The touchscreen is responsive If you like reading on the kindle it is worth the update This is a great way to read books on the go Theres no backlight so reading in darker rooms may be hard But its affordable and portable and a great way to take all your books with you I love the Kindle it is a great product It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it This is my second Kindle i bought this as a backup I am currently using the same headphone We got the Kindle for our daughter who accompanied us to try out the two Kindle models We were willing to buy either one and we assumed she would want the more expensive one with the backlighting feature But as she tried both she gravitated with certainty toward the basic model Why would U want to read in the dark She said As the weeks and months have gone by she says shes completely happy with the basic Kindle its exactly what she wanted Perfect Good able to read under bright sunlight conditions too Very easy to handle many books to choose from and very convenient I purchased this product because I love to read and buying books got costly With this product I can read all I want for 1000 a month it is smaller than i thought but it gets the job done Love my new Kindle I hadnt read in a while and hesitant of a kindle easy to use lightweight and convenient to pick up a book great for outdoor reading only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light crisp clear text and easy to set up Product is good light Amazing battery backup I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks Great product for reasonable price USB connection is easy Books are easy to download Overall everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best productmodel to start withUnderstandably this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before Features like LED lights White paper background are not available on this model These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights But again for this price you would not get any other good readersIf you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models Kindle is the perfect Ereader Easy to use and size is perfect to bring book on the go Easy to use and it arrived exactly as described Good beginner device for youngsters who want a device to read from Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasnt backlit I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference Target made the experience pleasant My fiance really enjoyes it I would definitely recommend For me the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping This model doesnt have a back light so Im unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husbandSo I returned and went for a Kindle Fire It is still the best device for buying books and reading them However go with kindle paperwhite if you read books in dark places Great product and service and the sales man r really nice When you first turn on the kindle the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book My wife loves it replaces a Kindle from like 2003 Its small light and easy to read from I just wish I would have spent the extra 30 bucks and got the paperwhite The more i use this one the more I wish I had the option of a backlight If youre on the fence as I was go with the paperwhite However if the backlight is not an issue this device is great and I would recommend it This device is good for entry level reader only in daylightIts doesnot support reading in dark To read in dark you will have to purchase a light or cover case with light attached I either case it will put a lot of strain in your eyes I love my new Kindle The size is perfect It fits right in my purse Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen I am able to read outside without a glare Only flaw is that it is not backlit so in order to read in the dark I need a book light I dont mind that so much I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle it would not load my books proper took a dozen tries erasing an dreregistering screen too dark I bought this for my daughter It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it In fact those of us with older model Kindles are jealous This is a pretty cool little device Im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience Only drawback is I wish it had more storage But for the price it works good Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional As always great job Very easy to use and its always with me Only problem I have is the button on the bottom is touchy but not really an issue Keep up the good work I especially like the Amazon has a system to convert pdf to kindle format Some of the things I read journal articles are in pdf format and I can email them to my kindle email and it shows up on my kindle with kindle format larger text You can find your kindel email at your account information Only thing I would have like a screen little larger Im happy to have it Very comfortable and easy to use every where This is my eighth Kindle Some others were either lost or screendamaged I bought it as a spare Current model is better looking than earlier versions white case sturdier and has an improved screen Great price also wish Id bought two My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study Excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling I love my Kindle Im back to reading so much more often as I always have several books with me at all times At first it surprised me that this version doesnt have a back light and you need a light to read but I actually like it now as I dont get the eye strain like I do when using my phone I love having real books but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad It also sucks that they are 4gig but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising Seriously It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS Lame The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background so its less bright on the eyes Its a perfect gift for young adult during the holiday session The screen is too dark and cannot adjust the brightness I should have purchased a kindle sooner Its easy to use and I love it This was purchased as a gift and theyve absolutely loved it Great Gift for anyone Very easy to setup Coexist with all IOT Devices Alexa is AWESOME Super excited to give this as a gift Its super convenient that Best Buy has Echo products in store instead of having to purchase from Amazon We bought this for mother in law buying another for me Well designed good sound has everything Alexa has plus the HD video Always ready with answers with associated video or text if applicable Can show movie trailers can also watch Amazon video Excellent ondemand security video with Amazon compatible cameras Voice activated message andor video calls to Amazon Show owners or Alexa App holders Highly recommended I have one Alexa and three Echo dots and having Echo Show now is awesome Omg I love my amazon show it is sooo cool and does a lot of cool stuff Great looking design Amazon Echo Show was easy to set up and use The product is very entertaining and useful Would recommend it to anyone Got it for few weeks but it kind of fades away from your life This device is awesome ‚Äò really lets you get very excited about smart home technology ‚Äò I‚Äôm buying a second one for my upstairs I purchased this for my daughter and when I tell you she was so happy she hugged the box then me and back to the box Overall product is excellent Speakers should have a capability to be used as Bluetooth speakers like the echo I have the spot dot and two shows I started out with the spot and loved it so much I wanted a bigger one This was a Best Buy  No pun intended lol I was a little hesitant to spend the money to get this but I am so glad I did Alexa always answers when I say the commands and I have noticed it is probably 95 right with any command that I have given Love the fact that I can see things on the screen Some of my news briefings have a picturevideo so thats nice too We also love the video call option Planning on getting one for my grandma who is not as technologically advanced and could just sit at a table and talk with the grandkids Worth every penny Great product very much recommended Service at Best buy is always the best I bought 2 of these for gifts I love my Echo and think the new one will be incredible too After the holidays I will buy one for myself I can watch videos check my security cameras and grey two for a fantastic price Dreams need topics song lyrics scroll during song play watch moviestrailers and etc With it if you can get it on sale bought my for special deal at Best Buy for 12999 not sure if the value is there at the regular price of24999 but it is very cool device information on weather updates on music events Fun questions answered while working in kitchen Good sound for a limited areaGreat sales assistance at Best Buy bought for christmas present for son and family so we can communicate visually The Amazon echo is excellent Easy to set up and we now use it to automate the entire house from our airconditioning thermostat to every light in the house with the Phillips hue bulbs We went and got one for everyone in our family I have both an Amazon Echo and Amazon Show and prefer the Show with the video screen I use the Show to display recipes when cooking lyrics to the music I‚Äôm listening to and video conferencing with my family I like seeing headlines of stories scroll across the screen along with the t8me and temperature I have only been using my Amazon Echo Show for a couple days now but it works great The microphone picks up my voice very easily the sound quality is great and it looks nice sitting on my coffee table this echo show lets you see so much great item for your home The Echo is very easy to use and has features that allow users to converse easily with others who may have a hard time learning how to communicate using newer videophone technology This product removes those barriers I love my echo show I wish you could watch movies or tc shows or you tube so hopefully they will add that soon Love all my Echo products and this one is exceptional as well Was able to look in my house while away Waiting for more update for access to apps in the future Little putsy so far but there are continuous updates that I think will make this a great device to stay connected with family Bought a second for my dad Who knows he might replace his land line someday if this gets better I do think our original Echo is a bit better at responding but I enjoy this one in the kitchen aka hub of the house Its at its heart an echo but having a screen on it with 1000s of things to do with it make it a much easier recommendation over the simarly priced screenless echo plus Amazon  Echo Show is the best of all my Amazon products I love the handsfree but able to see things on the screen I have 2 of these in my house work great I just bought 4 for Christmas gifts for my family We love Alexa Love being able to watch news briefings seeing the lyrics to songs and so much more Its in our kitchen and we use it everyday The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it Like that the music shows the lyrics Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though It‚Äôs awesome being able to control the lighting and lots of other controls with this I‚Äôm a big echo fan so this seemed like a no brainer I like it a lot but I‚Äôm disappointed about google pulling YouTube functionality I also feel like the original echo speaker sounded a little better and listened better with kitchen related background noise I was jealous when our son showed us his Amazon Show and some of the things it was capable of doing Since AOL eliminated Instant Messaging my wife and I were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors So we got two Shows and two Spots and now not only can intercom easily but use Alexa for music and many other things We will probably start using some smart home devices which Alexa can also control Its a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time We use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera Works great we tell it to show us the camera and boom there‚Äôs the video feed Super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show We use echo almost every day It is fun to ask questions The music is great We check the weather and listen to NPRnews Love playing music and talking to Alexa and looking at my camera three the screen I love the Echo Show and this is the 3rd one I have purchased two were presents for family at Christmas This one was for me I love being able to hear music connect with family via video and ask Alexa questions Best purchase I could have made Awesome sound which was unexpected Its nice seeing info on the screen such as recipes song lyrics weather etc I love the capability to see it on the screen and it allows me to not have to use my hands Screen is really nice great for videos I would definetly recommend it We bought the twofor deal as presents My mother will have a learning curve but since the other one is going to my son he can teach her Looks like a neat appliance but want to see if it can do more than weather music and turning off the lights By far my favorite Amazon product I bought one for every bedroom in the home Very fun to have music at the ready with a voice command We use it with Amazon Unlimited which has nearly everything Good to view recipes with Allrecipes so we keep it in the kitchen for reference and musical ambience The video is good too it has youtube functionality It would be nice to have regular tv though but that is probably on the providers for now nice to have the photo background and lastly to have lyrics on the screen when music is played I was using the original Echo seldomly Then I decided to get the Show I use the Show a lot more Was simple to set up and you can make calls with video Great product I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon  i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code nothing then a nother one and still nothing  i started to set up the device at 830 am and by 1120 am i was fed up with it i had to step away after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon  My dad uses this as a speaker for the tv and loves it He does use it in the traditional Alexa waybut the speaker option he discovered is an added benefit Alexa runs my entire house The Echo show is a great addition to the Echo family Everyone needs one Replaced a regular echo with this unit Allows video chat with our son in college and replaces a digital picture frame at a very affordable price We love the echo show Best feature is the flash bringing that gives us a rundown on news and weather each morning My girlfriend loves the echo show I bought two of them Along with fire TV a prime membership an amazon music subscription other home automation devices and the Alexa app on the phone this system is very functional It‚Äôs Alexa but it has a screen and it sounds pretty decent for a countertop device My wife loves having it in the kitchen for recipes weather music and fun I purchased this as present for a friend and since I have an Echo I can video chat with her to check in The quality of the video is great Like having another person in the house I talk to Alexa more then my wife I really love it I use it everyday and it works great We struggled with a surprise Christmas gift this year The store sales rep suggested this and it was a hit The Echo Show is a game changer its amazing as are all the Echos but with this one you can watch videos or see whos at your door The things that Echo can do are limitless its like having a personal assistant Another great product by Amazon super fun and great for entertaining the family and guests Great product fun to use Very easy to set up and begin useing Gift for a relative they said they loved the gift Same as echo but with a screen which adds to the appeal to this product Purchased this because I was buying the echo dot for my daughter and thought this would be fun for the family We play music every day on it Every one in the family is enjoying it Only dislike is that it doesn‚Äôt have the hub I live the echo show So easy to set up and use I have one in the kitchen and one in our main bathroom Alexa may be new but I would have thought some of the simple commands she would have been able to respond to already For the amount Amazon charges it should come with better instructions including what specifically to download into ones device iPhone etc so as to make some apps ready to go Amazon dropped the ball on this one I previously owned a Nucleus device which was similar to this device but was not a great device and had a lot of bugs and did not do much so I returned it This device is a masterpiece Not only is it tied into the Alexa Echo universe it can be used as an intercom throughout your house with other Echos and also can be used to view things and even call people that have Echo directly It is an amazing piece of hardware and Amazon should be proud of themselves for developing such a beautiful device I love the echo show it is in my kitchen and we use it almost daily to listen to music while we cook and also to find new recipes to try my kids use it to help with homework my whole family uses it with ease and everyone loves it Love it took the place off the echo in my bedroom Fantastic product and does exactly as described Great gift idea We really like that when you call someone you can FaceTime with them I bought it as a gift for my parents and they absolutely love it We love that even our four year old can tell Alexa to call papa or Alexa turn on the kitchen lights I find myself saying to my phone Alexa play I wish they made it for my car too Love how the echo show integrates with smart house devices and cameras I use it to view our cameras listen to music make phone callsvideo calls and even as a recipe guide when cooking I‚Äôve been very impressed Not going to lie  we haven‚Äôt even opened it yet Planning on getting it all setup tomorrow night I did see it at the store though  it was incredible I like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports etc Still not using it to its full potential but we have it controlling a couple of lamps giving us weather reports setting timers and alarms Its making me lazy Sometimes it doesnt hear my voice Hears my husbands voice better I find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table Love this Just replaced my old echo with this one Love Alexa I recently purchased the Amazon show It was easy to setup and use and I also added my own specialty screens and home screen Extremely glad I bought it we enjoy asking it questions about history  educational stuff for kids I LOVE MY ECHO SHOW ELEXA IS SO HELPFULL SHE ANSWERS JUST ABOUT EVERY QUESTION I HAVE I have the echo and a dot This is great for video calling and intercom calling in the house Use it every day I run all my photo‚Äôs stored on Amazon prime and for music What a treat What‚Äôs the weather forecast What‚Äôs the news this morning Just about all you need to know  plus Smart home control I purchased this for my children who are separated by miles Cant wait for them to open their gifts The Amazon Echo Show is a great addition to any connected home Allows me to link Phillips Hue and Nest systems to control with voice Great display and available information is awesome Worked as advertised  easy to set up and link to my wifi I love how you are able to get a visual effect along with audio from Alexa I think it is worth the sale price of 15000 but it has limitations For example it shows my calendar but you can only see the first item then if you ask for more you see the next 3 or so I The screen is updating with triviasome interesting some not so much I bet the next generation is a lot better Everyone should have this product It‚Äôs great to have when you are needing to see something and your hands are full or you can‚Äôt find your phone When I first read about Amazon Echo Show I thought the sound quality would be inferior to Echo because of the small size which to me would be a deal breaker I read that the sound is actually superior to Echo  it is compatible with most existing security cameras so I decided to buy one Then Best Buy ran a strong promotion if you buy 2 so I caved and bought 2 I have a number of Echos and 2 Echo Dots in the house I am completely BLOWN AWAY by Echo Show Here is a brief summary of thoughts LIKES 1 Substantially the Best Sound Quality of any Echo to date with stronger bass directional stereo Dolby Audio  focused sound field to the front You can rock out louder with less sound to the sides  back so you do not share your music to all as does the Echo2 The 8 Far Field microphones are more effective than Echo 3 High resolution 7 screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen 4 Song lyrics are great Free optional setting to turn on lyrics 5 Photos of the album cover  the band on all music are awesome 6 3 buttons on top Mute  Camera Defeat with red on screen indicator Volume UP  Volume Down 7 Excellent resolution with builtin camera 8 Auto presence detector turns Show screen on when you are detected 9 Speak to Alexa just as with Echo or Dot  Show mutes the volume  shows what you asked on the screen with the music volume lowered in the background 10 Ask the forecast  you get written  verbal forecast You also get a second screen showing the next 4 days including real feel a picture of the anticipated weather chance of rain etc 11 Say Alexa show me the Front Porch or any of the numerous security cameras  within 2 seconds there is a highly detailed live video with sound 12 Video conference  I do not know anyone else with Show yet so I cannot try this but call yourself  you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings 13 Uses the same power supply as Amazon Echo 14 Sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings see photo of Show in the center of the desk with 2 4K monitors  iPad Pro 15 The touch screen sensitivity is perfect 16 Build quality is First Rate 17 Rubber feet protect any surface  are anti  slip 18 Addictive More than any other device this is one you will want in the center of your desk as shown in my photo because once you add the video component you will wonder how you enjoyed music sports  just about everything without it 19 See your shopping list 20 See visual confirmation that the lights you ask Alexa to turn on actually turned on DISLIKES NONE I would only offer one design option I would offer an optional Amazon Echo Show Wireless Subwoofer for this beast that you could buy later It would work like the many Soundbars that include a Wireless Sub That would allow SHOW to not only ROCK OUT but to shake the walls at the same timeI am seriously planning to sell some Echos  Dots to pick up a couple more Shows They are GREAT This is actually for a gift Second one I purchased But great priduct I‚Äôve asked itquestions and answers were unknown and could not help me Great product Easy to use very easy to set up  This product is great and a nice addition to the echo family Connects with Echo Dot and Bluetooth with ease Works great We love our echo Use it everyday One thing it claims to pick up your voice from anywhere in the room but thats not always the case Its not a big deal just get a little closer or louder and she follows the requestanswers the question Love it Nice add on to work with Arlo pro cams or if you like to sing karaoke with alexa At first I was concerned with the funny looking angle I saw on the pictures The item was not displayed at the local store so I decided to take a chance As an owner of the Echo Dot i figured it would work in the same manner and it does I love that it works with the Arlo Pro The screen is great and I soon figured out the reason for the funny angle of the item The angled screen works great Only setback or recommendation would be to add a auxiliary output at the rear Also you can watch prime movies YouTube videos etc I bought the white version and have it in the kitchen I use it for EVERYTHING music video phone security cams news weather Its the perfect kitchen assistant This Alexa is the best one out of all them due to the screen feature I love everything about this Alexa if you‚Äôre on the fence just buy it it does everything If you like the Amazon Echo or the echo Dot you will love this for me the best part is when you make list or listen to music it puts the words on the screen for you For some time I have been searching for a replacement for my Sony DASH which had support discontinued recently While I am sure that being a bedside smart alarm clock was not the primary goal of the Echo Show it does fit the bill nicely This was my first Echo purchase and now I have multiple Echos and HUE lights Great system all around She is Alexa better younger sister Love her and some of the new skills great The show has a good picture and good soundlove using it to look things up This is an awesome product This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get 100 off I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both Ive being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time This Echo Show comes in handy I use it almost as much as I thought I would I am still learning all that it can do but my favorite part is the screen It‚Äôs not a huge deal but if I could change one thing it would be a detachable power cable instead of hardwired It‚Äôs good but not google smart it answers when no one asks Kind of spooky The distinction in the voice context is absent I like the ease and usage of the amazon show I have a amazon echo and I decided to upgrade to this for the video call Overall great product I have been transforming my house to a smart home So far thus is my favorite Does so much I learn more each day The visuals entice utilizing the product with greater frequency Easy to set up and works well There should be a manual to accompany the product Going online encourages the purchase of a book of directions rather than a simple online manual I enjoy getting recipes and news via Alexa Great speakers I bought the echo after seeing it demonstrated by my brother He proceeded to ask Alexa questions and Alexa would answer them immediately He then asked it to pull up some songs which it did right away Then he asked it to call mom and it did that as well Needless to say i had to get one I like the video feature for my doorbell Wish it automatically showed a picture when door bell rung Does not FaceTime Maybe later Also not all cameras are compatible no problems so far Im enjoying it suggestion  it should come with some outputs plugs to connect it to bigger speakers  sound system We love it to control the whole house lighting with Phillips Hue bulbs as well as just everyday use for alarms reminders questions news and even adjusting AC and Pandora Music Playlists Bought one for my family as well This is not my first Echo product  we have 3 Echo dots This is a step up for us I have it placed in the kitchen and love it The sound is outstanding and I love the screen feature I will be buying additional ones for family as well as myself Love this new Echo ShowThe best in the Alexa family almost a week late from release date from ups but finally got this and set it up which was easy Once in a while it doesnt hear you right but thats probably due to being 10  15 feet away with the tv on other than that no problems This item was purchased as a gift for an annual holiday party The recipient loved it I am starting my smart home and this was an addition to what we had already which was the dot and echo This is simple to set up and the kids can even control it We bought this to view our Arlo Pro cameras on something other than our iPhones The Show does a great job of this It is a fantastic Alexa device My minor complaints are that it is slightly smaller than expected and you can‚Äôt view YouTube videos on it Not huge deals at all but minutely disappointing This is awesome and the sound is amazing the screen is outstanding Very neat item fun to talk to Easy set up to use You can play trivia with your family and learn a lot about the world Love it  it‚Äôs my second Alexa it‚Äôs conceted to everything in my house thinking about buying more The ease of use and comparability with Smart Home products make a this an awesome product  I‚Äôve had Amazon Alexa since she first hit the streets over two years ago and Echo Show is awesome It can do so much more than Alexa and Echo Dot You will love it This is the favorite of the house even our visitors love it is amazing Purchased for my mom in a memory care center She doesn‚Äôt have to answer the phone we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us Picture clarity awesome Staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently Doesn‚Äôt replace room camera but good Would give a 5 but can‚Äôt figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her Anyone know Great product Absolute love it Alexa is fun to converse with and has a wealth of information I love that you and now see your answer on a screen with the Alexa Echo Show It was a bit more involved getting set up but thereafter the function is simply talking to Alexia The plug adapter to turn on and off lights TV is useful and certainly worth having Adds some nice tricks to the regular Echo lineup Video calls to other Show owners works well Speakers sound good THE ECHO SHOW WORKS WELL BUT AT THIS TIME IT CANNOT CONNECT TO YOUTUBE MAYBE WHEN AMAZON WAKES UP THE CONNECTION WILL BE RETURNED Its a lot of fun To fully enjoy it we had to get Amazon music unlimited We bought four of them so we can keep in touch with family Alexa is very entertaining I seen one that my soninlaw had and enjoyed using it I love how I can see my grandkids I also bought my kids one so they can just Drop In and I can see them It also shows words to some songs to sing along It is fun to have The best product I have used for AI Easy set up and easy to use If you‚Äôre lik me and trying to update your home into a smart home this is a must need I have by my bed side and am able to see the front door he echo show is great I can use it to monitor my outside inside cameras Alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated It has been wonderful I bought it for my boyfriend but I get more use out of it then he does The Amazon Show is a great addition to the Smart Home easy to set up and to link up with a hub The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems However the Amazon hot line was very helpful But who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues All in all I am getting used to the features and like it This is the best assistant from Amazon with the completion of the screen you can also see images from cameras and other devicesSimply awesome I am satisfied with this purchase I can see my family now without doing tango Skype  etc We can have different phones from iOS and android to see each other and it‚Äôs very clear thanks Amazon The echo show works very well with Bluetooth and WiFi Great sound and screen Recommend to anyone Works great Now if my dogs would actually answer when I call it would be even better They‚Äôre just not interested but at least I can see what they‚Äôre doing i love the addition of my echo show to my other Alexa devices Having the screen to read recipes and viiew notes is great If you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather markets and the latest news the Amazon Echo Show is what you are looking for Honestly the product is top of the line technology and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it and read the directions The size of it is truly perfect it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand and with that it truly can serve that purpose It also has a touch screen and I feel it is very durable and can stand to last The sound quality is also superb with dual 2inch speakers It has Bluetooth capabilities as well but it only works with android Samsung Fire OS IOS device excluding Mac products The Echo Show comes in two colors black and white The product has many different features and functions and they can accommodate pretty much anyone‚Äôs needs The top feature is the Alexa App which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything Then I believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want Also you can tell it to volume up or down as well Another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command Smart Home options A couple things that could be improved is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words and it will search for something you aren‚Äôt expecting The other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices so then you don‚Äôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly The price is also fair as well for its creative capabilities it has So if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the Echo Show would be a great addition for you Love the echo show so much Easy to use connects to your mobil phone to easily call people 9510 Rating  This has to be one of the best AI products I have used in a while The screen for an smart home device can be very useful It really cant compete with the Google home because the Show just brings convenience without having to call it I primarily use the show to turn onoff my smart lights simple cooking measurements simple math travel time store location hours calling and video calling and more Everything else like news calendars weather are already displayed on screen Definitely worth it if you plan on using all the minimum features above Love the many features  Highly recommend it using the echo saves me lots of unnecessary work and that‚Äôs amazing Used in my home office gives me all of the information I ask for while my computers are doing other chores Plays any music that I request decent quality sound I like my Show but i cant say i love it for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices it has probably the worst microphone Getting it to respond is frustrating at times where i have no problem with a standard echo besides this it all works as advertised Id wait for the second generation im sure they can work the kinks out I bought this as a gift As far as know it works fine Great sound and amazing options Love this Great replacement for original echo I bought this as a gift so I havent gotten to use it much yet The initial setup was really easy and I am sure that she is going to love it Facilitates easy home setup of many Smart devices Having 3 amazon echos I had to pick up these to add to more rooms These work best in the bedroom or kitchen Video display is bright Video calling is a great addition and is flawlessly get them when they go on sale I have multiple echos and dots but this one is way better Who doesn‚Äôt like seeing the lyrics of the music or using video chat with other echo shows I have two and thinking of getting another one soon User friendly hand free little assistant Makes your mornings easier and gets you started for the day And it looks cool I bought this for my sister for Christmas She loved them I love it easy to use Many different features The Echo Show is a very awesome product because of Alexa itself She will answer questions you ask her play music on your demand and you can even ask her to make calls and video chats for you I also like the fact that it sounds very nice and the video quality is unlike anything Ive ever seen in a hybrid tablet product A must have for your home it works well and sounds very good and the pictures are good too Bought the Echo Show because of the display and am not disappointed The Echo was purchased for somebody as a gift but this was purchased for me and is working great The only thing that I am disappointed with is that I have to go through Bluetooth to play my music which is on iTunes The display is also very vivid and clear Purchased this device at launch 2 pack for 384xx and now YouTube doesnt work YouTube was one of the main features that I used Without YouTube youll be better off buying the 40 Echo Dot instead I‚Äôm in love with Alexa Love her fir music quick weather updates and in the kitchen for recipes It‚Äôs great getting them step by step and not having to keep putting the passcode in on my iPad with hands covered in flour Amazons Echo Show has been a great help to my daily rutine From asking simple things like the weather to more specific things like flash briefings or traffic to my commute echo show is a great tool for any tech enthusiast my children loving alexa always talking to alexa every day hehehe Alexa is a great product that can perform tasks and answer all kinds of questions The Show and its video feature makes it that much more interactive I use it in my office as a personal assistant Not just for the home Alexa controls my lights TV and sound system Very happy with this We bought two of these for the kids They love them and I now have an echo dot Love the Amazon Echo Show The video display is so helpful Very good quality video and audio sounds better than the Echo Plus speaker Search a recipe and use it without flipping through recipe books Need to know a measurement conversion Just ask Alexa Learn cooking techniques recommended cooking timesendless list of available answers Great addition to my kitchen LOVE that we can play Christmas music throughout our home using all our Echo devices Lots of fun This works just like all echo productswith smart accessories you can control your home thermostat lights etc Alot of expandable options Love my new I Pad and New TV for my kitchenAlso bought 3 Alexa with pods for my family at xmas Just an average Alexa option Does show a few things on screen but still limited I got this as a spur of the moment thing I figured it was going to be super gimmicky but was pleasantly surprised that its actually a very helpful device for organizing shopping smart home control listening to music or even watching some videos while Im washing dishes My show is in my kitchen and Ive used it for countless things I think this is amazons best Alexa yet Gave it to my husband for his birthday and he loves it He is able to change the screen picture from his phone so there are different pictures everyday Nice to tell Alexa to keep track of what we need at the store Can‚Äôt wait to use it more I love the ECHO Alexa is awesome it was a Christmas present Also received two Dots to place in other rooms Bought this to start implementing smart home features Gets the job done and the screen is a nice addition If you keep asking it to do things you will be surprised at how much it can do Bought this for a Christmas gift so havent actually seen this in action yet Checked other reviews and they were good and Best Buy had an awesome Black Friday price The show is an all in one Alexaenabled machine I love the words to the songs and Im all about being able to watch my amazon prime videos Fun and easy to use Music sounds great Set timers reminders and sync your calendar Im giving one as a gift to my daughter so we can video chat with drop in any time Plug n play easy to use Speakers are good for music I love this thing It‚Äôs so fun and easy to use My 3 year old even uses it to play the trolls or lion king soundtrack The Echo Show is a great addition to the Amazon family Works just like the Echo but with a 7 screen Bright vibrant display Rich clear sound Works great with Arlo security cameras Excellent smart home addition Just hope Google and Amazon start playing nice with each other soon so youtube will work again purchased for a capstone team to test and review how it would benefit todays journalist This product is super easy to use and the sound quality is terrific I use it every day The easy of use is also appreciated Fairly easy to use on set up and use Most annoying issue is when the kids try to talk to her Mainly use for music and general information I do like the Alexa stuff and how it can connect to my phone Plan on getting the door bell video stuff next Amazon ECHO show is excellent with addon video features The screen is smaller than I expected but meet the requirements 4 stars only because its s e is bing works great with arlo cameras Display is great for doing video calls with others with echo show Works well with home automation devices Sound is great for listening to music I bought the Alexa Show on a whim and it was a great decision My wife and daughter absolutely love it and they ask Alexa questions and to play their favorite music all the time The display is very nice and I love the sleek look of it Amazon has outdone itself My daughter bought a show so my 10 year old grandson could get in touch with her when he got home from school so I bought one so he could call us and we can see each other We love it Great addition to the amazon device family Great Christmas gift We purchased the Amazon  Echo Show with Alexa in store Took it home and after connection wifi it was great we cannot wait to buy light bulbs and a thermostat Great buy I wasnt sure what to expect from my echo show but I am super happy that I bought it Alexa is great She tells me the weather traffic news updates and more each day Great for looking up recipes when your cooking and your hands are tied up Also perfect for ‚Äúdropping in‚Äù on family  friends I already have 6 Amazon devices 2 Echos and 4 Dots I expected this device to be slightly different as it is the only Amazon device I have with a screen I was pleasantly surprised at the large number of helpful features that a screen could bring It occasionally scrolls suggestions across the screen and most of them have been very helpful Im planning on setting another one up at my 93 year old mothers house Shell get a kick out of it also Bought 3 of these for Christmas for my Family membersI‚Äôve had mine for a year in my Kitchen and just love itSo much you can do with it and works great with my 5 Arlo Pro camerasBig plusAmazon is Always updating the Show to do more Despite a less than friendly price point if you dont get it on sale this Amazon item is well designed and delivers on the promises in the hype and product description The emphasis with this item is show so its no surprise that sound quality does not compare with the Echo but if you want the convenience of a voice controlled screen other than your phone this product delivers Its value is even greater when paired with other smart devices such as security cams Another added bonus comes when friends or family also have a Show so that you can do drop in which is essentially visual phone calls Its great for checking on elderly family because it does not require them to be technically savvy Previously had 2 echo Dots in play at my home so knew I wanted more from my Alexa Echo show now in kitchen and allows easy review of youtube for entertainment and recipe instructions Also like streaming music and having the lyrics stream too Very cool Looking forward to Alexa learning more and more to respond to my questions on various topics Hands free is the way to go The Alexa Show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the Show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that I had in the older device Im not sure if Im missing it in the Show but I was able to get internet cameras on the older device such as San Diego Zoo Elephants that you cant get on the Show While certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch Setup was pretty straight forward and easy It is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent It is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want such as play or start or open I use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then 4 more or other combination You would have to set up several different alarms one for each day as far as I can see Some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming I dont really want to be terrified awake each day I found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well It would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what youd like I dont see that yet anywhere Another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off If you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times Id rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe which is possible but very sensitive and if you miss here comes snooze Just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly I am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so I can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time Hoping that works well when it arrivesIt will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed All in all Id say its a good emerging technology but needs a little work Considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago Its kind of where were heading Alexa Show is really well put together The main reason for my purchase was to create my own surveillance system linking my Ring Doorbell and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen Yes you can talk to it and get results for almost any query but with the show you get a lot more The touch screen is great for video calls especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon or tell you where to get them The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you but SHOWN to you Also when music plays you can see the lyrics on screen If you use Amazon Music to play the music You can ask for a news briefing and you SEE the news highlights etc The speakers arent quite up to the same standard as the echo series but its close The sound fills the room nicely When the Echo Show is not being immediately used the screen shows a picture of your choice making it a digital frame too Overall the device is very nice and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use so it seems like there is always something new to wow you Turning on and off lights adjusting your thermostat playing music viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties there is WAY more to do with this device I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot Black Friday gave me reason to buy one I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it I may be getting another  No real upgrades to the iPhone 7 from the 6 There is no learning curve for sure However the camera is better and that is a plus We have greatly enjoyed using Alexa and having this gadget in our kitchen I love the echo show It is a personal assistant DJ weatherman  news person all in one This is our second Show We love the video qualties  the sound cant be beat My entire family enjoyed all of the purchases we from the store Wife wanted this gift and it did not disappoint its the next step in Amazons capabilities adding visual to the sound that was already there I had an Alexa but thought the show would be cool as it would allow me to link a camera to it see videos for info I wanted to look up play my prime video account It would have been a 5 if I could see all prime showsmovies on it The echo show works great for home automation Being able to see your security cameras or drop in on your home through the echos camera are great features Its great just needs expanding information on it We had the Echo still do its just in another room and purchased the Show We also have a couple of Dots and have them all set to communicate with each other As you walk by the Show it gives mini tips news fun facts etc Love it You can even use it like Skype with others who have a show My wife wanted this so I got it as a gift Even though I have had an Amazon Echo for a year I think the Show is much better The screen takes a lot of the mystery out of what Alexa is doing Both my wife and daughter love it This thing is awesome great speakers on it too Go out and grab one Our 5th Echo Show We love the Drop In feature allowing us to use them as an intercom The ease of playing music on all of them at once throughout the house and controlled from any device is used daily The connection to our Sonos system is a real plus Also connected to our Dish TV receiver I love the Echo Show and its many features great purchase I use to communicate with family I love the drop in feature and it‚Äôs much easier to hear everyone as opposed to FaceTime on speakerphone It has more to offer but that is enough for me to recommend for anyone who uses video to keep in touch Was recommended to me and we love it use for music timer in the kitchen great recipes and love the question of the day only have had for 2 weeks can‚Äôt wait to explore more Bought for my daughters dorm good device for streaming making calls etc even for quick weather report Love it so much Have been using it every daynews YouTube videos buying more smart home products to make good use of Alexa I love this unit Very well designed and built Its very easy to use and has a huge amount of features The screen is beautiful but the audio could use a bit more bass IMHO I bought 3 for Christmas gifts The screen really does add tremendous value The bugs are almost all worked out and the quality of hearing my commands is night and day from a month ago We really enjoy the Echo Show I have the Echo in the living room  the Echo Show in the bedroom It‚Äôs great to have the visual of all the requests for Alexa Love it bought one for everyone in the family I know they‚Äôll love it too Purchased for my 87 year old mother as a safetyconvenience entertainment device She loves it finds it easy to use loves to have music throughout the house Amazon has made another great product The ‚Äúshow‚Äù goes perfectly in the kitchen Recipes musicweather All done hands free Fast set up I bought these as a gift for my adult kids to video chat while in college The second best feature was YouTube Amazon just sell google home and chromcast for goodness sakes Another great echo product really cool feature is the lyrics scrolling across the screen when playing music It works fast and very clear speakers sound amazing looks great in bedroom I have several versions of Amazons Echos  the original and Echo Plus 2 Taps and 2 Dots The Show is the best sounding of the bunch and you have the screen as a bonus I added a battery pack to make it portable and its perfect for us I love it It does so much and is so easy to use I use it mostly for music and questions I love the Echo show I have found so many uses such as weather updates recipes and random questions My grandkids love it for stories songs pictures and just being plain silly I dont think Ive tapped into its full potential yet I dont think a person can go wrong with this purchase Fun and useful very interactive and still learning all abilities It‚Äôs great I use it a lot and yes I will tell friends and family about it I really like it it‚Äôs userfriendly and I was by 55 Coolidge from Apple family to the family It has been a lot of fun using in our kitchen I think we use it much more than we thought we would Alexa reminds me of all my appointments and it‚Äôs a great tool Nice way to see the internet and also to view security cameras Very handy device Easy to log in and set up Good sound Needs a remote for the volume as is changes with each radio station song or replies alexa is awesome and screen makes her even better cant wait to get another Thanks for the display version of Alexa  I love this model This is a must have is great for recepies while you are cooking Alexa gives you the info For the ines that are used to a tablet or iPod that you have to stop and read this is awesome plus So much easier to follow things Love Alexa and everything she can do So great you can connect to other devices I bought the echo show for my mom for her birthday and she loves it We use it all the time I have a lot of Echos devices Each room in my house has some kind of smart speaker I have also Google Home devicesThe Echo Show is the best device to use in a living room or kitchen The screen is bright and sharp and its a nice feature to follow recipes watch videos or even listen to music once the lyrics are displayed on the screenIts also the best way to see calendar entries to do and shopping lists I love the show It was so easy to set up I use it every day for music and weather info Cany wait to see how it works for Christmas cookies I am just learning what the Amazon Echo Show will do Ive used it as a timer Ive listened to Iheart radio I love the smart lights that I bought at the same time Alexa turns them onoff when I tell her to When the holiday rush is over I will go online to learn many more things This thing is really cool love that it gives all the words to songs I‚Äôm an amazon prime member and the show is awsum I use it to communicate with the son who lives in Seattle You can watch amazon pirime tvplay amazon music Text play games read the lyrics while the song is playing I love it One of my favorite gadgets It can do so any things Easy set up simple to use and lots of fun Alexa can tell you the weather forecast play any music you‚Äôd like to hear read you recipes and so much more Great product Not a very responsive program Very limited information program Not user friendly Best item I ever use I would love to get another one Alexa does a lot of fun things but you must enable various apps She gives funny answers to funny question However she is not a complete internet surfer many things she has no answer I bought it for my son in laws birthday after they bought me one for Christmas Not just good for music but helpful for grandkids homework and now we can video chat with grandkids which the one year old loves Using it in my kitchen The whole family has access and we can all use different functionality Great for looking up recipies music and calling relatives or friends I got this to work with my Arlo Pro camera and it works well I am able to have my camera for driveway and front door come up on command I hate that I cannot get my Samsung TV to come on with a verbal request I guess I will have to buy the plug for it This was very easy to set up Downloaded the app and plugged it in viola it walks you through the setup I waited a couple months to review giving Amazon time to make this product equal to the SONY Dash from nearly a decade ago it isnt the screen provides nothing of value and you cant turn of amazon tips you have near zero customization cant even move the clock to the other side of the screen And something that a sony dash did nearly 10 years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm seriously this is the biggest fail Run away from this half baked Amazon disaster Im impressed with it I can monitory my Arlo cameras at when ever i want and I can treat my Sirius radio Very easy to use and good quality nice picture and good size for a desk This Alexa device is great fun and useful for several personal assistant type applications I use it in conjunction with some TPLink Light switches and it works flawlessly It is nice to see the lyrics to songs she plays and calling other people who have the show or spot works well She is also really good at setting reminders and alarms Another useful feature is as an in home intercom I Love this I dont even have to turn on my tv I just talk to Alex a and she does what I tell her Great help from assistants in the store They were very knowledgeable and took the time to help me choose the right product for my needs Its nice to see my calendar and the sound is good too Its a great product but for the cost the speakers are not what they should be and the screen is too small Choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out Hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls Voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot I am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance Easy setup for connections to wifi cameras Amazon Digital Subscriptions and coming soonYouTube Add your videos and BOOMto the screen they come Good for Amazon music and news Brilliant for controlling lights in the house I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day Everyone in my family loves the camera function sound quality picture resolution and basically everything about itIt isnt totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music pictures videos to having your favorite book read to you One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added Although we have several echo dots everywhere my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud The sound is amazing for its size thats a huge plus Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is its shape Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for I have it connected to our home security system robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone Taken all together it is useful fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home This is an awesome device but it isnt life changing It is basically the same as the Echo I dont use the video much Amazing how much stuff this can do everything from a alarm clock to listening to musicasking questions and controlling devices the sound front the speakers is really great Love this product easy to use and it does so much ch purchased the show after I picked up the ECHO PLUS 2 DOTS  a TAP This smart home system is addictive and I will be adding more soon Does what it is advertise for and more Had fun setting it up and amazed on what it can do I even use it for security Love the ability to video chat with grand kids Enjoying the music everyday Its an awesome item Me and the kids love it Great product Use it in the kitchen and can see who is at the front door with it being connected to my ring doorbell Recently divorced I bought 2 of these tonserve as homebase for me and my 8 year old It has helped him to know there is one spot in both our houses he can reach me by simply saying drop on daddy My wife purchased this for me at Christmas Was very surprised because she said she did not want a device like this in the house I think she is enjoying it more than me Easy to link with nest thermostat and smart plugs Even figured out how to operate older garage door with it If I can only figure a way for it to bring me a beer now We really are enjoying asking Alexa questions and she is connected to our Sonos system playing music around the house She doesn‚Äôt always understand me Not sure if it is her or me I loved this thing until it was time to go to bed Although it dims the lowest setting is still very brightlike sleeping with a flashlight in your face I hope they make fixes that will allow the screen to dim more Also not crazy about having a camera connected to the Internet on my nightstand If you cover it up the motion sensor then wont work The sound is OKnot quite as good as the nonscreen Echomaybe because its not omnidirectional like the regular Echo My enthusiasm for this device has subsided quite a bit because of these issues Got one for my mom in order to video chat with her Works awesome Such an easy set up My family and I use it for so many things Wake up in the morning the morning commute traffic report Recipes facts phone calls and of course music Since I got it and have had friends and family over they have gone out to buy it as well Excellent purchase Well worth the money Second purchase of Echo Show Love the device and all of its features Used primarily for communication with my 90 yo mother I drop in theres nothing for her to do but talk and smile  I use the Alexa app on my phone with mom which works very well and still use when mobile but I got this one for ease at home Amazing I seriously didnt know what I was missing until I got the Amazon Show While I have Alex Echo and love this having a screen that can connect to other smart home devices is amazing I love the jokes random questions I can ask or telling me the weather Its essential in our house now The best part about the echo is that you can actually use it to watch videos the security cameras connected to your house listen to music and watch the baby sleep I love my Echo Show Already had 2 and when these when BB had a BIG sale price I couldnt order it fast enough I can see my Nest cameras another 5  product make video calls to other Show owners voice calls to anyone else except 911 and a whole host of skills that are being added almost daily My only regret is not replacing my 2 remaining Echo Dots when they were on sale I wont make that mistake on next big saleI also received 2 of the other home assistants included as free bonuses for buying a couple of other things I thought that it was only fair to compare the two disregarging the video aspects of Show Amazons Shows and Dots Echos were like comparing Lambourgini to a 68 VW Bug Setting up these things are like the expression I heard as a kid Easier than fallin of a log and not near as dangerous I purchased this for my husbandHe had been waiting for it for a long timeHe owns Alexa and loved iti do too The Echo Show device connects with a range of services including Amazon Music to expand your experience Ask questions and see the answers with the Echo Show which connects to Alexa for an immersive search experience Love Alexa especially the touch screen  can play games like Jeopardy I love the Alexa system of assistance This version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won‚Äôt get to have to the option to pick up You need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private I installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use The echo show does so muchthe music line up is goodit can do anything This was bought for a gift But it looks nice Just what was expected Excellent addition to our Amazon components It is especially better than other versions at hearing varying voices and responding to commands A great new Amazon device to add to my other Alexa products The visuals are amazing and it is so easy to use and set up Lot to learn but great device Connecting to other devices can be frustrating but over time should be better Connect to my Bose blue tooth speaker then tried the dot Seems connection can be to only one device at a time Still checking help app but limited info I love it it works great I love the drop in func I love having this in my kitchen it has replaced my ipad that i used to use I love to use Alexa to listen to music set timeralarmsand ect My parents use the show to show the cameras and stuff for a second control panel to their security system Was debating on the purchase but looked very cool good quality video chat is clear I got two of these super easy to set up Only used them one day so farCant fine one thing I dont like about them I am loving my Amazon Echo Show It makes life easier I love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking Alexa I also love being able to video call friends and family that have an Echo Show or the Alexa App Overall it is a great product Love the Alexa AI Better than apple and google versions The screen gives even more points because you can see all of Alexa‚Äôs responses as well as video call Awesome Works great with my Ring doorbell and Ring security cameras Love that I can see live feeds on my Echo show 150 is a good price for this Alexa with a screen Great accessory for Alexis systemhelpful and fun The amazon Show has to be one of the best smart home devices that every came out Alexa Videos music and drop in Amazing product Requires too many components Cameras etc stick with basics in my opinion Very easy to set up and use Really like the screen to view the items searched for and to read information about the searched item It does everything amazon and I can even see who is at the front door with Arlo It doesnt do Netflix or Hulu but thats okay I really like the sound it fills small rooms Its easy now to video chat with Nana or drop in to tell my kids goodnight when I am working late This really is a great product it has performed as expected so far A great new Amazon device to add to my other Alexa products The visuals are amazing and it is so easy to use and set up I love my amazon show it‚Äôs a recommended product if you wanna have this item However the down sides are it has a great speaker so if it‚Äôs full max it may be hard for Alexa to hear you Another downside google hates amazon  not YouTube I bought this device for my girlfriend to use in the kitchen so she could look up and see recipes and instructions when trying new food dishes The device is great for this We also love being able to listen to music world news search for items or products and easily order items from this device We also are able to connect other devices and operate lights in the home It does so much more I think this is a great device for the home Great electronic  very easy to install me and my family enjoy the things that Alexa do very satisfied with my service that I received from Best Buy when I purchase it looking forward to shopping there more often and Im a new customer there Such a cool product We primarily use it for music‚Äî definitely rivals brand name speakers but can be used for so much more This is great The entire family is using it Son‚Äôs are using it for it music husband for appointments me for just about everything It‚Äôs useful and fun Great product will recommend it to friends and family What a neat gadget I thought I loved my echo dot n this is so much more I like that u can video chat with other people who own it also The kids love it Bought this for my better half and she loves it It works very well with echo and has unlimited features I was hesitant on purchasing this new echo but Im glad I did I really like having the feedback on the screen and seeing results in addition to the voice Using it for weather recipes and anything that can be displayed is a big help The echo show responds fairly fast and looks great in my kitchen counter A definite winner on this one It did exactly what its suppose to and Im still learning new features a month after having it Very good decice If you use the Alexa ecosystem then the show is a must This is my third echo and the video screen is a nice addition Id like to give it 45 stars but not an option The only thing thats is not as good as my previous ones is that I feel the microphone does not understand me as well Also at this point the screen has a lot of potential but not much is implemented yet eg watch cable tv over internet As good as echo with added visuals can be usefulAnd fun I use it for everything Mainly as my new alarm clock cant wait for them to open it up even more Recently upgraded from Alexa 1st generation Really like the video screen and how much more it can do I love it I can call and do video camaras hear music My Echo Show is my Christmas gift to myself So far I am having great fun with this nifty new addition to my Amazon family of home monitoring devices I have connected the Show to my Ring doorbell We put in the kitchen for the holidays and used a lot of new recipes Alexa found for us I like how it has the screen but I do like the echo plus better Both gets the job done Got for my parents as a gift Simple to use and they like it Got on sale so was good value I use it alot to play music instead of running the tv for my dog when we go somewhere I use it for a lot of things Bought my 5 daughters each one for Christmas  one for myself  love the concept Great video quality soundmusic from a rather small device Seems well made entertaining and more functional as we learn its many features Bought for my parents they love it Easy to use and setup Haven‚Äôt set it up yet but really looking forward to using it I have a regular Alexa and love that so This should be even better Echo show has proven to be a handy gadget useful for lots of things like checking weather and just about any info on the webalso has great interfacing with other smart tech like arlo cameras ring doorbells fire tv etc the more I use it the more I find it is useful and the more I like it not a real fan of AI but Alexa has become quite handy entertaining and informative The Show itself allows us to contact family that is in Florida and teleconference with them in 1 simple stepShows family photos stored in Amazon accountOne word simply AMAZINGBought 1 for my parents and they USE it I bought this as a gift They love it It is really helpful to have around the house Great product with alexa in control you may need extra time to jog Added screen a great features visual effect a plus Love it Simple setup Ease of use Very intuitive and fun Awesome product DoEs what it says and looks great Purchased for my husband but this is more a gift for the entire family Luv the display This product is great I wish there was a way to play music from my phone other than Bluetooth only She is not a technical person but enjoys the screen feature and uses it for cooking recipes Its not open yet its a bday gift But I think they will love it Amazon Echo products are terrific and and quite helpful Imagine taking the Alexa voice and adding some video to it Really cool Great for the kitchen where you can use it for recipes as well as music and other things Love it Does everything I want it to do and more i loved this product so much i have bought four of them for christmas gifts Long time Alexa user The video screen just takes it to the next level great product I loved the Amazon Echo but to be able to see so much more on the screen is amazing I highly recommend I bought this as a gift for a relative with Amazon Echo in his house He loves it Great and easy to set up We have this in the hallway and the whole family uses it Alexa is learning what our family likes each day My 8 yr old daughter uses it all the time as well I like the display with news Found out a command to turn off screen which was bright at night I havent used for movies etc but that should be fairly simple Sound is decent and picture quality is not bad too I bought with 100 discount on two This product worked very well and very easy to use This amazon echo is awesome my girl loves it im happy The three star review is for the situation described here not the quality of the unit I ordered this online and picked it up in store The package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory The Echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package When I hooked it up however it said that the unit was registered to someone else It wasnt a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine I spoke to both Amazon and Target about this and neither could tell me what happened I was offered an exchange if I wished I chose to keep the original unit but I wanted to make others aware of the issue I have one theory Target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for Target resale and they are all registered to this person I guess Ill never know The Echo itself works fine and Im very happy with it After you hook it up make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates Then you should be good to go Love that I can view my arlo cams on it  love it plays movie trailers on point  love the lyrics when playing music  love the video calls love the drop in to other Alexa devices around the house they now work as intercoms so I can be in the 3rd floor of my house 3 story home in Las Vegas  the doorbell rings I can say alexa show me front door arlo cam then I can say alexa open front door drop in on the echo by front door and say come on up  Just having a blast with this stuff  yes I am in deep with the smart home thing alexa turn on the lights hue color lights  turn on the fan wemo switches Alexa set house to 77 degrees nest  so endless  yeah I would say the ECHO SHOW IS A GOOD START  I use this thing every night to fall asleep Although Alexa don‚Äôt always understand me I still love the device Finally decided to try Alexa Lights heating doors etc everything is homekit compatible in my house But this one was too tempting What a great device Alexa is years ahead of Siri great system to have by your bed and it also controls most of my devices Love this product able to read recipes instead of just hearing them Speaker is pretty good too The device works well mechanically however the software needs a lot of work Half of my commands are not understood and I have cameras linked up to it that‚Äôs rarely recognized she loves it got it for her for xmas we all love to play with it Love the new video version  Easy to setup and great to use Echo show is a great productGood with my security cameras and playing musicYoutube would be great If you use an Echo you will love the Echo Show Bought this one for a relative after they experienced mine Great product and it is very easy to set up and use Echo show easy to set up Wish it included the swivel base that is a option now Love the added video Plays any music you request answers questions even tells jokes to my 10 yr old Much more capability than weve unleashed yet Alexa with screen LOVE it Works perfectly with my Ring doorbell We got this since we have the previous echo and love them Easy to use and set up Highly recommend Its a lot more then we expectedthis is a wonderful addition to our tech life I bought several Alexa‚Äôs for Christmas gifts also for myself also bought Amazon Show for Christmas gift also for a my youngest Daugter  This does the same stuff as the traditional Echo or Echo Dot except it has a screen If you already liked the Echos this is a good addition The addition of the screen is neat but certainly not essential You can see daily news headlines and the weather scroll across the screen You can watch any Arlo or similar cameras on it You can watch YouTube and Amazon Video as well but youll probably just watch that on a phone tablet or TV instead I love the the ability to video chat and watch videos on how to do stuff Just love it Some very innovative Very user friendly This was a Black Friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and Alexa worked well with the Ring doorbell system There are times when you have to ask her the same thing over and over until she figures it out but overall it was a food deal Bought this for my mom She thinks its great It is easy to use and hooked right up to all her previously owned items The video screen really adds wonderfully to the functionality of the echo devices This amazon echo is most likely the best way to go A great addition to our home Kids love it and is vary helpful Got this for my mother whos eye site has been failing to the point of not being able to dial the phone or write down appointments She can now video chat with members of the family Send emails check her appointments place phone calls just by requesting it It has helped her so much Nice device Good to enable drop in conversations Some flash briefings But overall still a little limited in effective use of video My wife said I‚Äôm developing a ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù homewhile I‚Äôm still learning what all I can do with this over the regular Echo I am looking forward to getting my Ring Doorbell installed Great product I can rave enough about them It‚Äôs good I don‚Äôt know what I am doing Can u say you tube Purchased this item for our daughter She absolutely loves it I love the echo show The only thing I dislike is it doesnt play YouTube videos Not a deal breaker though a bit difficult to set up but it is amazing Love the screen Bought the Echo Show to add on all my smart wifi appliances wifi video doorbell smart TV  sound bar wifi smart lights wifi smart thermostat wifi security camera system and so on Great overall would be nice to have parental controls though The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that‚Äôs compatible with my mother‚Äôs Arlo Security cameras It works great I bought 2 shows and I am loving them Them video flash briefing are wonderful and personalized I dont have to keep my phone on me 247 to keep in touch with my closest family members they can just drop in and I can do the same with the kids when away from the house I made 2 more purchases immediately after to put them in my office and living room I love the lyrics when music is playing and looking at the forecast on the fly They are a must have for a modern home Enjoying Alexa There is so much you can ask her Looking forward to the security monitoring  I love my Echo Show It is easy to use and being an Amazon Prime member I can play all my songs I cook dinner listening to music I also linked my SiriusXM to it so i can listen to my favorite music It is so easy to use my 80 year old mother wantwd one Product works well and is fairly simple to operate The Echo show screen is great it is helpful with recipes music etc I use it to listen to music all the time I am hoping someone in my family gets one soon so we can face time each other Like the fact that I can see videos and utilize ir with my lighting system I bought this for my elderly parents that refuse to get a smart phoneThey loved it and feel safer with it I programmed it to call 911 if they fall and need help Plus they can see the grand children without any confusion Video integration its big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check whos at the door when doorbell rings qc is really bad on this product and does not catch the voice properly I didnt expect this device to be so diverse unexpected surprise THIS IS AWESOME WE LOVE IT SO MUCH TALK  C PEEPS It was a cool device but my main issue that it couldn‚Äôt play playlists the I had stored on the sonos app It only played streaming services Love this thing Little apprehensive at first But Alexa will grow on you We love our echo show It‚Äôs fun to use and she can do a lot of things When I purchased this item I was unaware how much it really does I can literally control my entire home with it Too many great things to say about the echo show I have had an echo dot for a while but the new echo who adds video I literally use it everyday multiple times a day Great product Amazon Great sound easy set up The screen seems sort of wasteful now that Ive been playing with it Maybe it has the capability to work as a digital picture frameIm just certain yet I was able to set one picture to itNot multiple Would be nice if could be used for Hulu or Netflix and stuff since the picture and sound are so clear I like the visual to do and shopping lists Still worth the purchase A good want to havejust not a must havethen again maybe I have not tapped into all it can do Not only does it round out my collection of Alexa devices I have two echos and one dot it also works well with the Ring 2 Video Door BellI can see who is at my front door without opening it It is amaizin I like the way you type and search my favorites Worthless except as a regular echo and a poor excuse for video chat I love my echo devices bathroom pool kitchen other places where I may need hands free voice activated music and info My wife bought me the newest hottest thing I was skeptical but then thought I would use it to help on a project Me Alexa find videos on f450 drone Alexa YouTube is not available Amazon wont directly sell chrome products youtube wont play on echo show Further testing shows the video call is more limited than iPhone or Android apps for video So the most useful thing now is the same voice functions that my echos and dots perform Unless I want to make all of my video calls and check the weather from a device I can move no more than 3 feet from an outlet It is a great product It works great would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to buy one Got this for my dad for Christmas He likes that the speakers sound better He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it Great device for me because I already owned bunch of stuff that supports Alexa Needs more skills And need YouTube to work If you like video this goes along perfect a must buy Purchased the Echo Show for my wife and she loves it Full of great information weather and more Can control lights and various things at the house Even askes you the question of the day Easy set up and to use Mainly bought it to monitor the Arlo Pro 2 cameras we purchased Only download was very slow and echo show didn‚Äôt make it worth having as a stand alone Great device Love Alexa being able to pull up home cameras to view I feel the audio on the show is the best when compared to the echo echo 20 and obviously dot Nice to have next to bed instead of a dot and an alarm clock This amazon echo show is great for room monitoring It was priced well and I find it useful We are new to connected home equipment I got this for my wife in our kitchen The only thing I wish was different would be that the Amazon Show would communicate directly with FaceTime rather than having to have someone download the Alexa app Not a deal breaker by any means though We love it I love my new Alexa Show Checked prices thoroughly and Best Buy was was the ‚Äúbest‚Äù and 5 minutes away Product is great Easy setup and works as stated Staff very helpful Would recommend this product and definitely this model  We purchased the Echo Show for Christmas this year and love it so much Our kids got the hang of it faster than we did ages 11 and 13 Highly Recommend We bought the Amazon Echo Show for my dad We set up accounts for him to access music and pictures and wrote down a sample list of commands he could use He loves it Excellent product No end to the features you can set up This device is alot better than the small alexa Did everything i wanted it to Great amazon device i love these have 2 in my house they are awesome A step up from last years Echo Great addition to any part of the room I bought this as a gift for my husband and he is constantly asking Alexa questions about everything We love listening to music on it as well Was so excited to get this It is so much fun to use Great product but the only downside is that it did NOT work with my home security camera Great sound and picture Been using as a baby monitor Still new to Alexa so still learning what she can do The Echo was so good I ended up getting the Echo Show as well At first it was a device that I enjoyed using for various reasons one being that I could ask Alexa to watch any YouTube videos I wanted to watch Then one day I asked Alexa to play a video and she responded by sayingGoogle is not supported on Echo Show Until YouTube comes back as a skill the Echo Show probably isnt worth the extra money Id say stick with the Echo if you have Amazon Music or Spotify or the Echo Dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home Having LOTS of fun with Alexa Tells us weather stories plays music trivia games with us helps with shopping list and can face to face talk with my sister in another state bought one for her too  great addition to our home Talk to it and see responses on the touch screen Love it This is a great addition to the Echo family bringing new and cool features Great device for music and face time calls The sound is crisp and clear Many options with the Echo Show Easy to set up But it does not work with all phones I have Samsung 4 Easy to set up and use Useful and fun The videos make things easy to understand We bought 2 of them and love them The screen is really clear and the sound is amazing Go get one I love all of my Amazon echo devices Right now it doesnt allow YouTube but hopefully they will reach an agreement and fix that if nothing else I have peace of mind that should she fall or need assistance then I can now better assist My mother has dementia and this keeps her busy for periods of time She is fun to have around Just got this in the mail last night Setting it up today and I want to love it The kicker for me buying it was being able to connect our Arlo cameras and view instantly The display in the store had great sound love it and it only keeps getting better over time Great product i recommend is easy to use and fast Nice way to see the internet and also to view security cameras Very handy device The Echo Show is a version of Alexa with ability to visualize things When I was cooking dinner and wanted to finish a show I was able to ask Alexa to play the show from my Amazon Prime account The Show was in my kitchen easy to view and enabled my kids to watch cartoons in the living room I love it Everybody enjoys this product We use it to show each other things from my home to my daughters in Melbourne Florida keep a running shopping list that can be seen just by asking and for both verbal and visual reminders of events I was unsure if this was worth it before I did After buying and bringing it home I‚Äôm glad I did I enjoy being able to video chat threw it Bought second one for my mom and she loves it so much Bought for my 88 year old Mom she loves it help her with recipes and cooking Enjoy being able to view my Ring doorbell camera in live time upstairs This echo is amazing and it doubles as a picture display The Echo show with video screen is a nice upgrade to the other echo‚Äôs News briefs with videos are nice Very good sound quality for playing music I saw there was a new Echo with a screen and had to have it I use it for Amazon Prime videos YouTube music with lyrics recipes and viewing the nursery with Amazon Cloud cam The speaker is louder than I thought Good purchase but I‚Äôd like to see more features for the screen This is the main reason why I went with Amazons Echo ecosystem vs Google Home I bought one as a gift to my sister so I can easily videochat with my family My niece and nephew tend to fight over the Echo Show when they want to sing along to their favorite songs with the lyrics on the screen My only wish was that there was an HDMI out to connect it to a larger monitor Huge missed opportunity in my opinion Im disappointed Sometimes gives doesnt understand Echo show not only plays your music it puts up the lyrics to read from I didn‚Äôt think I would like the Echo Show ‚Äîespecially at the 200 price point but I tried it and love it If I could afford it and if they would add an audio port I would replace my current Alexas with Echo Shows The Echo Show is a great improvement from the original Echo device Its great being able to see what is going on The Echo Dot is a great personal assistant and right now the price is fantastic It can give you the weather forecast traffic reports daily news brief play music from Pandora or other steaming radio stations and answer questions all in a very small package  Bought as a gift for my wife she loves it and the screen is very handy for recipes and such This thing is cool you can do a lot of neat things with the show hope they add more functionality to Alexa though We have echos throughout the whole house and have this in the kitchen Controls lights  you can FaceTime  my wife uses it for recipes and it shows the videos of directions This item is a great addition to your smart home but just as the first gen Siri it is not all there yet The kinks still needs to be worked out Alexa does not have answers to a lot of things or commands Theres a long learning curve Setting up with apps is a lot work Its fun if your large circle is willing to spend the money to get one each Great landline replacement We are enjoying our amazon echo show Alexa is so amazing answering questions and a variety of music Great device to stay in touch with your family if you leave in another city or state I love all my Alexas I have the Echo and now for Christmas I got the Echo show Not I can see my recipes and also connect with my family I have a couple of these echos they are wonderful they do everything like turn my lights on or the TV my granddaughter love asking it question Needs to be a stand alone device I should have not required to use a tablet of Cell phone to make it work Amazon needs to work on the technology on device We loved the Echo Dot but the Show is exponentially better Especially love to see the words of the songs being played and views of places all over the world we want to see Big difference in cost between dot and show but worth it I really enjoy having another way to communicate with family and friends Awesome all around product  great picture and like the voice control I knew this item would be great but the Echo Show has exceeded my expectations Alexa has changed my life I now own 3 Alexas O Great product with cool features Easy to install I love the way it looks and feels I dont know why I waited so long to bring Alexa into my home Its how I listen to my music now dictate my shopping and todo lists and get my morning weather report just to name a few I highly recommend this item The show works great with my other products Love it I was hesitant and I am now hooked This is both fun and useful Not sure will be keeping this Worried about hacks that allow active mic Loving it the ability to call up and watch sesame street with my daughter its awesome Love our Echo show A few enhancements we‚Äôd like to see in future such as ability to load multiple pictures instead of single photo Can use Amazon photo but we do not prescribe My whole family loves Alexa We have the dots in all the bedrooms I love the smart home features you can add I love the music offered as a prime member And when you‚Äôre bored at home she will play games with you or even read you a book Love the echo show Nice to have a visual Love the drop in feature Can use many differents apps from the Echo Show Awesome product I got this for a really good price I already had the Echo Dot that I was kind of unimpressed with I love the echo show There are so many more things to do and the sound quality is great I‚Äôve been enjoying this item and getting information so fast Best purchase I ever made Easy to set up Plus the screen is very clear and easy to view Not sure I would like this however words to songsGreat and ability to view my outdoor and Indoor cameras is a plus Still learning to use Family is having fun with Alexa I do like the way it integrates with other devices around the home Arlo Nest Life amped The features of this device have added a new dimension to our everyday routines Pertinent and usable information by just simply asking Superb product Alexa show is easy to navigate It‚Äôs wonderful having so much information at your finger tips I already the Echo Dot and saw Amazon advertising for the new show over the summer Got it as a gift and personally I love it The speakers and sound from it are great Plays the lyrics for any songs you have going so you can karaoke without sucking now Also displays the time since I got rid of cable and no longer have that it is nice to have a clock in the living room Very easy to interact with I really enjoy using Alexa even watch videos utube many things its worth buying My daughter can‚Äôt wait to get this set up in her room Great product that a whole family would enjoy It‚Äôs a perfect addition to the household Great sounds Works great with Ring doorbell and nest cameras as well  We have all three Echo products in our house Each with a different usage Got the Show for my parents and sister as well to communicate as we all live in different places More for my parents its ease of use is ideal for them no computer knowledge needed speak and they can connect with us Best New Adult Toy in years Wish I had purchased one for my parents LOVE IT I am so happy with this product It is so helpful to use st any time of the day Ican do things while I am lying in bed definitely recommend this product You will be amazed how this works for many questions you ask and Alexa has the answer However do not expect her to know everything You will be happy with this purchase Amazing Voice recognition great at long distances Amazon music great Cant say enough good Video calls work great and the screen is super informative Between this product and Siri AlexaIs much more useful and reliable It controls many things in my home and is very dependable Only one problem commercials activate Alexa when it hears them I didnt think I needed Alexa to have a screen but now Im so glad we got this When I ask to see my grocery list it pops up on the screen Also can do video calls from it Really like our Alexa and the dotswe have them in almost every room of the house now Wish the angle was adjustable When this is sitting on a table or counter it is angled up and the further away from it you sit the less likely it will see you in its view when trying to call someone Love the Sirus XM update to play through this though The speaker seems louder and better than the regular Echo but that is just my thought If you were able to get two for price of one this is a deal worth taking We use it to talk to our granddaughter play games listen to music and check on the dog while we are at work Awesome device We already bought one for our kids also First bought the Dot to see if we liked it We enjoyed it but wanted a little more volume When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room For larger rooms the Show is a great choice I got it for me and my brother for Christmas Great gift Great price Very functional Love device wrong color Overall great device for Family The echo show is great works awesome together with my wink hub I can controle my whole house another cool feature is I can sync my google calender to it and it shows my upcoming events on the screen Highly recommend the echo I was against getting something in my house like this being skeptical about hackers watching thru the device However this is the greatest thing since sliced bread It can do just about everything And the sound is fantastic when steaming music Being able to change the dish network channel by saying it is so convenient while hands are in the flour for ex Access to information is endless and immediate with her replies We love it The show is our new best friend We watch shows on it everyday at lunch time And we end every night saying ‚ÄúAlexa turn off screen‚Äù this is pretty cool we love ours we listen to music and the sound is great my kids are always asking her questions we can call on it set reminers timers and alarms for us it was worth the price but one thing I dont like is that it nickles and dimes you like even though I have a prime membership all music is not available  I had to pay to upgrade to be able to listen to everything and it doesnt stop there even though I upgraded it if you purchased the dots not everyone can play music at the same time to do that youll have to pay to upgrade again but even so I dont regret this purchase and the whole family enjoys it Love it  Easy to use No problems setting it up Very impressed set up a little confusing but overall a good experience Still learning However Best Buy emails give away any gift secrets  Had to reset my account to a work email address Already an amazon consumer and user of Alexa to control home automation products The Show is a great addition for us in the kitchen displaying receipts and visualizing things that before could only be heard So easy to set up Still learning what she can do Happy so far I love my echo show Screen is so clear and sound is so high quality I have several around the house and love playing music on them easy setup and we can now talk to each other and see each other very easy great way to keep in touch without a computer Great product I‚Äôm at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition I love the fact that I can just use my voice to use my electronic devices Bought for sons  family they have small children and I never miss out on seeing them live  love it It is very enjoyable to be able to listen to the music at any time and great for parties and poolside This is a very nice concept and I think it will take on more usefulness as Alexa gains more skills The design is a little clunky Googles version looks nicer but I already has Alexa devices to tie in to The sound quality is goodAlexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement Very similar to FaceTime on an Apple productYou can watch someone show you how to do something like a project you are working on Instead of listening you can see it Alexa is now a family member How have I lived my life without her I have no idea Nice except unlike a Google Home you can‚Äôt just ask it to play music You eventually have to purchase their music after s free trial Alexa is there to answer those questions you do not have an answer for along with news and weather This is a fantastic item  the person I bought it for loves it Echo Show is everything I thought it would be and more The alarm and music actions are the greatest It syncs with my Echo displays slideshows recipes and lists controls my Fire Stick and sounds pretty good It doesnt play You Tube videos but it does do a good job playing videos The Echo Show is hands down the best device of the Echo lineup I‚Äôve bought at least one of everyone except the Tap I use this to call and check on my grandparents who I got one for Christmas It‚Äôs amazing watching my arlo and ring cameras on the screen Also watching news segments and looking at cooking recipesvideos is great It‚Äôs also the easiest to set up of the Echo Devices you don‚Äôt even need to use the app I bought this so my kids can talk to there Grandpa and it has been Great they call him all the time I bought this for my business to monitor the arlo security cameras and it is amazing This is a perfect upgrade to my kitchen Amazon Echo The speaker itself is a substantial upgrade over the Echo and Dot I have it connected to my Nest security cams and its great to check on my dogs when they are having play time in my fenced backyard It can be a bit distracting with its random invitations to try certain skills but the distraction is worth it This product absolutely represents the future that I imagined when I first watched Back to the Future 2 decades ago The only cons that I can think of is sometimes Alexa doesnt hear me so well same for the Echo and Dot and it currently cant differentiate between users like Google Home can I have had the Google Home too and would highly recommend any of the Amazon devices over the Google Home This is my 5th Amazon Alexa product I used to have the Alexa Echo but moved that up to my bedroom Now I use the Echo Show downstairs and has good sound quality I also like that I can add my Home Security system to operate through it and can see all my cameras Great product Works well Havent been able to work out the local traffic yet Love my amazon echo show however I wish Alexa knew a little bit more I bought this as a gift for my daughters 22nd birthday and she totally loved it Now shes wanting me to buy a second one so that I can keep it on the first floor She says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other I think it was a great purchase so I think Im going to have to buy another one Works good Have to be very careful with kids Overall good product Addition to my systemlove talking and seeing my BFF in ATLSUITS MY OFFICE decor Got this so Grandma could stay in touch with Grandchildren Works great and easy to use This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon It works great in the kitchen Better voice recognition and sound The onscreen display and information are very helpful The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while workingcooking It can also scroll personal photos as a picture displayAll in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition Well worth it especially if you get it on sale Its neat It does what all other amazon alexis do but a little more I feel as if should still do more This is a great device when used with Ring camera and Hue lighting Thoroughly enjoy my new show Love the scrolling pictures I brought my tube amplifier to Best Buy and my Magnolia rep hooked it up to a pair of BW 700 Series 2 speakers WOWIt sounded like Etta James was right in the room Fantastic Works great Very responsive and quick I love tying the whole house together with this and the echoes Love the look love the size love that it is VISUAL I like it Currently it is the only smart system with display It makes it easier to talk to the device My only issue with it that it has a slow processor Yes it‚Äôs a little glitchy sometimes But so useful and fun I‚Äôm hoping that over time Amazon will continue to improve on the errors in Alexa When contacting customer service it doesn‚Äôt seem like Amazon is very interested in learning the problems that need fixing though Great item to upgrade your house Works very well Very cool  It fully incorporates all of my Smart Home products Very happy with adding Alexa to the kitchen The Echo Show is great for looking up recipes getting a weather and traffic up as I‚Äôm getting my morning coffee or just listening to music Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy They also enjoy music on demand Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill made sure there were no new updates for the Show the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem Useless is no help less than useless actually makes more work The Echo Show is less than useless This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it After about a week youre going to be wondering what else can I do what else can this help you with So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start Then prioritize the purchase of an echo not plus and a spot Makes things easy to do like listen to music check the weather hear the newsetc just make sure you say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù loans and clear Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt hear you Great to have for time recipe or entertainment I recommend everyone get it This amazon product is amazing easy to set up and to use I do recommend getting prime music with it for only 499 a month that‚Äôs a deal The family and I love Alexa view and once we got it we were hooked now everything in the house and outside is run by voice commands The opportunities with this are endless I recently had purchased enough smart home devices to make this a good addition for the home It works well with smart outlets our Ring doorbell and fairly well with our Nest ThermostatMy only complaint is that sometimes for no reason it will start plying a movie trailer and its hard to get it to stop Still all in all were happy with the purchase It can stream music really well and not just from AmazonI was expecting it to be smart like Watson but it is more like an Blank Stare Amazon should look into predicting questions like during 2017 Superbowl Play Offs Alexa was unable to display or update the Play Off Brackets It understands my voice really well were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what I am saying It want pair to my Portable Bluetooth Speaker It will pair to my cell phone but only to receive Music from itThe Audio quality is varies with amplitude With low amplitudes Alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room but an amplitude setting of about 50 the audio becomes clear and understandable I really like playing games like Jeopardy with Alexa No climbing through the closet to find a box anymore and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing Amazon hit it out of the park with this one I am able to connect this to NEST cams and Ring cams as well Songs come with lyrics sound and looks great Echo Show does everything from weather to turning on off my lights I am so happy to have the Echo Show I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some loved the echo show my only complaint is that youtube will no longer be available on it That is one of the main reasons I purchased this as a gift Other than that the product is great Easy to use This Amazon Echo is very user friendly and provides hours of entertainment with anything from recipes news videos and Amazon music with the lyrics is like having your own Karaoke I have multiple Echo devices so purchasing another was a no brainer I enjoy this one as it is video capable The only thing I wish they would add was a way to pivot the camera and or improve its low light capabilities for poorly lite rooms I have had the Echo Show for about a month now So this review is from a new user whom has never had smart devices aside from cell phones Alexa is great for listening to music most of it free if youre an Amazon Prime member pair your Echo device with a bluetooth speaker for awesome sound Alexa works well with smart home devices such as light bulbs outlets and thermostat Most of these are really easy to set up so you dont have to be a very technical person All of which can be voice controlled or remotely via the Alexa app from your smart phone If you have a friend with an Echo Show you can make video calls via the devices or directly to a smart phone which is pretty awesome for family and friends whom live far away As far as answering questions do not expect the best answers The Bing search engine needs some work If you want to ask the questions she prompts you with on an Echo show shes your girl but if you want to know something you might have to look it up yourself IE weather forecast you get whatever Bing uses and the short version If Bing would expand their horizons in searches I would definitely 5 star this item She does fairly well with recipes and shopping lists I am going to be trying out the calendar sync portion of this with my wife after the holidays All in all very fun helpful item It can order you pizza too Is better than face time when calling my kid since they have one IÔ∏è could call them from my and see them at the same time perfect for cooking timer n best for music Setting up the amazon show was a little trickybut I managed to navigate through it It‚Äôs so cool to add compatible equipment I have really enjoyed these products so much I actually bought 3 of them Fun to watch and even better if you are an Amazon Prime customer for music and video As advertised I love my echo show it does so many interesting things I‚Äôm on it all the time I recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting up to date information I am enjoying the Echo Show a lotVery entertaining I had looked at this for a while I was thinking about purchasing it when Amazon was offering the buy on get the second one for less offer but when both they and Best Buy dropped the price to 149 I jumped on it Its perfect for my kitchen because I can use the screen to pull up recipes and I can video chat with my kids that live out of State I would say that this is a great addition to any Smart Home Absolutely love the Amazon Alexa devices we now have six in our house and have them connected to Sonos nest Arlo and other devices I purchased it so the weather and info can be seen on the screen At the time I never knew there was an echo spot or I would have tried that The show sounds good however I wish there was a ring or something on top that would light up like the original alexa Easy to install very easy to use we enjoy the product and learn more about it all the time Great item for the new home Better than purchasi This is a good product We have the original Echo two Echo Dots and the Echo Show to complete the family  love the ability to play videos and the lyrics display on Prime Music is awesome Bought two of these one for the living room and one for the bedroom great when you dont feel like walking to the living room and need to talk to your significant other honestly dont use it much but when i do its great music shopping stupid questions movie times etc I bought this for our kitchen where we enjoy cooking and congregating Streaming music is great and you can search for recipes just by asking Alexa Our whole family loves and uses this device for so many different features We love using it to make phone calls watch films play Jeopardy even to define words as they come up in conversation We definitely get a lot of use out of this device more than any other screen tablet or smart phone device we own FUN TO USE FOR ANY AGE JUST SAY ALEXA A nice next step in the Alexa repertoire easy to set up and to use It is so convenient to have a display with Alexa function I Searched online and talked with people for two weeks before purchasing When I went to purchase the echo show amazon dropped the price Love this product am glad I purchased it Having a blast listening to any kind of music and asking questions So we added this to our Echo family of devices Its nice to have screen but I honestly dont find I use it as much as I thought I would The video calling feature would be pretty great IF we knew more people with a video capable Echo device Also weve had some technical issues that I havent been able to resolve as of yet Ultimately this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter Its also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras but you should probably investigate its features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more traditional echo devices Its essentially an Alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker so something to think about this product features a beautiful screen to enhance your viewing and information love this product Simply love it It‚Äôs loud love watching videos This product is amazing I do however wish that there were more video features on it I love my Echo Show Easy to set up And fun to use The echo show is a great accessory to any house  It has a great picture on it and great sound  It‚Äôs simple to use  My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists  Also listens to music with crisp sound Can ask Alexa pretty much anything  This item seems great on the ads but it reality it can‚Äôt do nearly as much To get it to do more you have to download ‚Äúskills‚Äù some of which work well and others of which do not Some are reviewed but many are not Connecting is often difficult and sometimes the password you use has to be the same as your Alexa device which no body tells you I‚Äôm sure with some practice this device will be fun and useful but learning to use it and sorting through the skills is a pain Upgraded from echo to this and this is just what I needed Works well with my new Ring door bell and security cameras Love the versatility of this Echo Show is a great addition to any home and we were thrilled to buy one for each of our childrens families during this holiday season With this you can make calls to other echo shows Or using the app you can call others that have the a show I havent used this feature yet since Im the only one I know who has one I can tell you that while using the app at home or away from home off the network you can call the show I did this while at work to check it out and caught my son coming in the back door I freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome You could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever wherever you have it Keep in mind youre only gonna see what its pointed at The camera doesnt move Plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward There are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down Almost forgot but the speakers are amazing You can link multiple echos together to play music I have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a JBL speaker in another room After set up through the app I can tell Alexa to play music and they all come to life Love the new Echo Show Picture is clear and the microphones pick up my voice from far away My wife likes it for recipes on the go and the Show it is always thinking Music sounds great coming from this small unit It was the talk of Christmas Got this as a gift for my sister and her fianc√© and they love it Works great with Phillips Hue I love this new Alexa device with the screen I bought it for my mother who really couldnt relate to the Echo Dot But she can read the output I works seamlessly with my Apple Calendar so she can see her activities of the day Also can call her Great Grandchildren just by talking and see them too I own a dot and a first gen echo and the sound from the show is way better than both of my other echoes The video functions are nice but it is a pain to get it to play videos from my Amazon library My family enjoys the calendar info and the news briefings that rotate on the screen We already love our other AlexaEcho devices and this is our favorite The drop in video chat feature is my favorite Nice to see songs and many other items Shows words to music can watch u tube And video calls Nice to have good thing to used love to  Would tell people about I like the Echo Show I can view my cams watch a movie and read the news The camera video is slightly delayed And I do wish it had a jack for earphones But the sound on mine is good I have dots and an echo and this just sounds better and looks better I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it The screen is big and alexa responds clearly and quickly Bought it for my son  wife They love it Both thought they didn‚Äôt need it They find that it is a lot of fun and very useful Very impress with the echo show and all of its features I think this is one of Amazon best products ever I first review the echo online and watch youtube video It is better than I read or saw on line This device is seriously cool The basic functions out of the box are nice but some customization and configuration allow you to do so much more My family loves the ability to play Amazon music with their voice Smart home integration is a big draw Nice device We use it a lot in the kitchen and the home automation The video is pretty good and the speaker is better than I thought it would be If Amazon and Google can work things out the Show will be amazing We already loved the Echo and the Dot and were looking forward to adding video Unfortunately YouTube is no longer on the Show limiting the video content If they can ever get it back the Show will definitely be a 5 star product The show is definitely amazing especially if you have the doorbell with video and security cameras you can see it with echo show I love this product The possibilities are endless Its great I love the hand free whatever you want It plays videos on Amazon by just asking it to play At work I can video call my girlfriend at home with the show as well Highly recommend Purchased to stay in touch with family while traveling Absolutely Awesome Great product recommend that Everyone have one Traded my original echo for echo show Glad I did screen is excellent and syncs with many home connected devices Promising product that has been getting better with software updates since release I upgraded from Echo and have no regrets I didnt liked design from day 1 but after mounting on the wall the screen looks good I like it more then I except it Much easier for reordering or shopping on Amazon Amazon echo show working very well as expected and thanks to Amazon for adding more features on regular basis The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions and you can view videos too I also like that you can see the temperature and date without having to ask I like you can view a video of a recipe not just see text The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio systemI have two dots and love them The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system Even though this feature does not exist it still is a great product Delivered on time and it looked good will hook it up next year This is the most amazing item And very easy to use I use alexa to control my smart home and get internet information Best Xmas gift and great product made by amazon Now my fam is all connected bought these for family members out of state for Christmas finding it is way more than expected Can talk face to face with them make shopping lists listen to stories play interactive trivia music games is there no end to possibilities They all LOVED their gift thank you Best Buy for great sale to make affordable We purchased the Echo Show after using the Dot for a couple of weeks The first thing I noticed is that the Dot‚Äôs ability to pick up your voice is by far much better than the Show However I think the Show‚Äôs speaker is better for listening to musicThe screen on the Show is handy for looking at recipes seeing the shopping list or watching the timer Could you live with just the Dot Absolutely but there are some nice features that make the Show a handy gadget to have around Amazon show is pretty cool It can help with things like cooking recipe homework and other things But its restricted to only Amazon partner things If Google comes out with something similar I would have definitely chosen that over the show No YouTube Love the Echo Show Allows me to control lights alarm vacuum and lots of stuff No brainer to set up Make lists keep up with calendar Plays music Tells jokes and sings‚Äîbadly but is fun Couldn‚Äôt be happier with it Were still learning all the things this device can do So far Were very pleased The Show is a great little product It has opened a lot of doors in the world of AI and home automation for me It connected easily with my echo and dot and now I can stream music all over my house The picture quality is outstanding The only drawback is that Alexa doesnt have a very strong internet search engine We were interested in the Echo line of products after we purchased our Vivint security system The Echo Show is a perfect addition We are able to view our security cameras from the The Echo Show and it works great in general as an Echo with all its features Great to talk and see family at anytime Easy to use I love having the screen available to use for certain tasks like streaming doorbell video security camera footage Amazon Prime music lyrics and videos but I am disappointed that Amazon‚Äôs implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violated Googles terms of service so they got the app pulled from the Show Also honestly and anyone can prove it just through everyday use but the Echo is just not as useful as Google Assistant with inquiries It works pretty well with home automation but it just doesnt understand or cant help with about half of the inquiries I throw at it I would have gone with a Google Home if there was one with a touchscreen I would recommend it for those heavily invested in Amazon Prime and home automation Love it Love it Love it Love this Just replaced my old echo with this one Love Alexa This is great Like having a robot brain in your house Alexa Show is really well put together The main reason for my purchase was to create my own surveillance system linking my Ring Doorbell and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen Yes you can talk to it and get results for almost any query but with the show you get a lot more The touch screen is great for video calls especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon or tell you where to get them The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you but SHOWN to you Also when music plays you can see the lyrics on screen If you use Amazon Music to play the music You can ask for a news briefing and you SEE the news highlights etc The speakers arent quite up to the same standard as the echo series but its close The sound fills the room nicely When the Echo Show is not being immediately used the screen shows a picture of your choice making it a digital frame too Overall the device is very nice and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use so it seems like there is always something new to wow you Turning on and off lights adjusting your thermostat playing music viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties there is WAY more to do with this device This is just what I was looking for It does just what it says it does This is perfect for any home it gives up to date news you can set alarms and do so much more We love this product I couldnt believe how easy and fast the setup was Its basically plug and play I watched a video first and it took no more than 3 minutes to get going You dont need any other equipment to set it up The sound is unbelievablebetter than my Bose Upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras Sound is much better The Echo Dot is a great personal assistant and right now the price is fantastic It can give you the weather forecast traffic reports daily news brief play music from Pandora or other steaming radio stations and answer questions all in a very small package  Addition to my systemlove talking and seeing my BFF in ATLSUITS MY OFFICE decor We love Alexa Love being able to watch news briefings seeing the lyrics to songs and so much more Its in our kitchen and we use it everyday I bought this so my kids can talk to there Grandpa and it has been Great they call him all the time Now I can view my front door Ring system as well as all my Arlo cameras Great products If you have Echo Spot in each bedroom you can video talk with your kids by dropping in Love it Got this for my wife for Christmas Was suppose to come wrapped but didn‚Äôt Wife very happy Avid amazon fan Sound better then the echo Use a lot of home automation and this is a great addtion If you are not an Alexa or home automation fan I would recomend trying to catch this on sale you may not need the screen a much as you think The sound quality is great This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it After about a week youre going to be wondering what else can I do what else can this help you with So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start Then prioritize the purchase of an echo not plus and a spot Awesome so far Have used it as alarm clock stereo 2nd screen for movies while multitasking on PC newsweather audiobooks and more The news flash can repeat itself at times but I may have subscribed to too many subcategories but a quick alexa  next skips right ahead Still learning the variations of commands and sometimes it hears what it wants to until I have to ar tic u late to the point of annoyance but hey this is still relatively new tech and who would have imagined this 20 years or more ago I like it Needs more features to really become a good product Needs browsing capabilities This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon It works great in the kitchen Better voice recognition and sound The onscreen display and information are very helpful The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while workingcooking It can also scroll personal photos as a picture displayAll in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition Well worth it especially if you get it on sale Purchased this item for our daughter She absolutely loves it After researching and reading endless reviews I bought myself an early Christmas present in the Amazon Echo Show Once I had it home it was quickly set up and has been a joy to have since day one Loved it so much I bought two more as gifts So enjoying being able to see friends and family on a more regular basis with the video option I‚Äôm sure as I learn more this will become even more useful Great addition to my other Echo devices Alexa is a wealth of knowledge and learning more and more every day I didnt think I needed Alexa to have a screen but now Im so glad we got this When I ask to see my grocery list it pops up on the screen Also can do video calls from it Really like our Alexa and the dotswe have them in almost every room of the house now I am very pleased with the sound and picture quality It does not link to direct tv This was a Black Friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and Alexa worked well with the Ring doorbell system There are times when you have to ask her the same thing over and over until she figures it out but overall it was a food deal Love talking face to face with family and friends back in the Philly area It is easy to use and to stay in touch I can show family things that I have recently bought by holding it up to the camera instead of having to go into a long description on a phone line Once you have it you cant live without it Great product The show works great with my other products Love it Love the echo show  the ability to communicate with smaller children without any effort or cell phones The echo show works very well with Bluetooth and WiFi Great sound and screen Recommend to anyone All I really use it for is music The read downfall is it‚Äôs not Bluetooth so it has to be plugged in 247 I have all the echo products in this by far is the best it does everything  I love it Were hoping the Echo show will allow us to elevate our experiences using the screen options for calling family  friends as well as reading recipes etc So I was skeptical of Echo Show and the entire line to be honest However this technology has changed how our household operates From my daily briefing in the morning to tracking Santa with my 6 year old every morning learning interesting facts about Santa and several other things I truly wish I would have bought this sooner We have it integrated into our Cozi account so we can just ask Alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in We also have ADT Pulse and a Nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple I couldnt believe it My son loves to ask Alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoonAnother highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is I am loving the Amazon Music now as well because we bought an Echo Dot just to integrate into our Bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house nowIf you are on the fence about getting the Echo Show like I was just do it It really is an amazing product I will have one for all my rooms I will also buy some for friends I can see my grandchildren when I call it is a great machine Love the screen and being able to see video along with my cameras on my Vivint smart home Absolutely Love the echo Show It is in my kitchen I love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there My calendar is there too Plus I scroll pictures on it from my Amazon prime photos Love being able to get the daily news briefing from MPR every morning Also use it for timing things Would highly recommend it to Amazon prime members Got it at a great price on sale prior to Christmas Amazon built upon the success of their Echo Im really enjoying the convenience of the Echo with the added display I have put this in the kitchen to use for recipes and controlling various devices Not a very responsive program Very limited information program Not user friendly The echo show is a great accessory to any house  It has a great picture on it and great sound  It‚Äôs simple to use  My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists  Also listens to music with crisp sound Can ask Alexa pretty much anything  The Amazon Echo Show is so much fun I got it for my husband for Christmas and its absolutely more of a gift for myself We also got hue lights and have set it up our routines This show is so much fun We listen to the news in the morning while making coffee it wakes us up with slowly with the hue lights we listen to music while cooking dinner cant recommend it more Because of this purchase I am also buying a spot We love the camera feature where you can drop in so we will continue buying these rather than the security cameras for the inside at least where we just want to say hello or see our dog Worked better than expected Highly recommend the Echo Show I‚Äôve always loved the amazon Alexa smart products and use them to control my smart home setup Purchased to stay in touch with family while traveling Love this product able to read recipes instead of just hearing them Speaker is pretty good too I use the echo show to stream music video chat and drop in as a camera from my home You can even see recipes and other items Worth the money got it on sale I always wait for sales at first I wasnt sure if this was something I needed when I already have the echo but it was on sale for black friday so I thought why not As soon as it was set up I understood why I needed this It just enhances everything Alexa does Being able to see what she says is great Seeing and adjusting my shopping list by touch is amazing I love walking in the room and seeing little news blurbs It looks sleek and beautiful on my counter I highly recommend this to anyone Each and Every Version of Amazon Home Products have gotten better and better This Amazon Home is the Cadillac of Amazon Home Products The News Feed on the screen at all times along with the options and features that you can do with this is amazing I love the ability to call my mom and dad and see what they are doing They are only a couple of miles away but it is fun I also love playing music on the device since most of songs include the words You might find out that you have been singing the wrong lyrics for as long as you can remember I control all my smart home sthings with it and also have 2 echo dots I LOVE MY ECHO SHOW ELEXA IS SO HELPFULL SHE ANSWERS JUST ABOUT EVERY QUESTION I HAVE I like the video feature for my doorbell Wish it automatically showed a picture when door bell rung Does not FaceTime Maybe later Also not all cameras are compatible With a Seamless integration and easy functionality the echo show is wonderful piece of tech that is entertaining and useful to the whole family Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill made sure there were no new updates for the Show the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem Useless is no help less than useless actually makes more work The Echo Show is less than useless I have the spot dot and two shows I started out with the spot and loved it so much I wanted a bigger one This was a Best Buy  No pun intended lol The Alexa show is a great product and the price was even better I‚Äôm all about the smart home and I love my new echo show I stay more connected with my family I also love how it‚Äôs integrated with my Arlo Ring Nest and Hue light bulbs Love this We have it on our kitchen counter and great for music news updates amazon delivery updates recipes timer and soo much more Tech is not totally friendly but for The cost and what it does it is worth the investment Great product and it is very easy to set up and use Purchased for my mom in a memory care center She doesn‚Äôt have to answer the phone we simply drop in and start talking until she sees us Picture clarity awesome Staff also aware of this camera feature and knows we drop in frequently Doesn‚Äôt replace room camera but good Would give a 5 but can‚Äôt figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her Anyone know Works well with smart home lights door locks and wireless security cam Great product I‚Äôm at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition Got this for my dad for Christmas He likes that the speakers sound better He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it I like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports etc Still not using it to its full potential but we have it controlling a couple of lamps giving us weather reports setting timers and alarms Its making me lazy Sometimes it doesnt hear my voice Hears my husbands voice better I find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table I am loving my Amazon Echo Show It makes life easier I love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking Alexa I also love being able to video call friends and family that have an Echo Show or the Alexa App Overall it is a great product It is a great product It works great would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to buy one So having Alexa on hand could be good and bad Its nice when Im cooking and I need help with a recipe but it can be annoying when my kids fight over what they want Alexa to answer Over all its a nice product connects to my Ring doorbell too which is nice The Echo show is addictive Pairs easy fantastic sound and video and once you download the Alexa app and learn a few things it becomes indispensable Video calls work well Great for the office or Kitchen I like the Echo Show I can view my cams watch a movie and read the news The camera video is slightly delayed And I do wish it had a jack for earphones But the sound on mine is good I like that you can Talk To Alexa I like the lyrics to the music I like the personal Assistant It is So wonderful and limitless User friendly hand free little assistant Makes your mornings easier and gets you started for the day And it looks cool This has been perfect for the kitchen it plays music  I can sing along with the words on the screen Love that Alexa also allows for multiple timer settings when cooking Echo Show is a great tool in the kitchen Paired with amazon music it makes the time go by quickly Video selection could be better somehow needs to strike a deal with Google for access to YouTube video It does have nice video for recipes Amazons Echo Show has been a great help to my daily rutine From asking simple things like the weather to more specific things like flash briefings or traffic to my commute echo show is a great tool for any tech enthusiast I‚Äôm in love with Alexa Love her fir music quick weather updates and in the kitchen for recipes It‚Äôs great getting them step by step and not having to keep putting the passcode in on my iPad with hands covered in flour Bought as a gift for my wife she loves it and the screen is very handy for recipes and such She knows all the answers I‚Äôm used to speaking to her i recently visiting a friend and said ‚ÄúAlexa ‚Äú And my friend looked at me like I was crazy She doesn‚Äôt have Alexa It is great to be able to make video calls from the kitchen Very convenient Needs to be a stand alone device I should have not required to use a tablet of Cell phone to make it work Amazon needs to work on the technology on device This was bought for a gift But it looks nice Just what was expected I have not used this as it is a gift for my parents Will see how they like it a bit difficult to set up but it is amazing Love the screen with this echo line we are able to watch amazon prime and even do visual calls to grand daughter Great to give as gifts I bought several items for staff I have several around the house and love playing music on them I bought this as a gift for my husband and he is constantly asking Alexa questions about everything We love listening to music on it as well The touch screen adds a new dimension to the Echo which comes in handy when ordering off of Amazon or reorders as well I also like being able to view news briefings and song lyrics on the screen also The Echo Show is the only way to go The Echo show screen is great it is helpful with recipes music etc I use it to listen to music all the time I am hoping someone in my family gets one soon so we can face time each other I bought the echo after seeing it demonstrated by my brother He proceeded to ask Alexa questions and Alexa would answer them immediately He then asked it to pull up some songs which it did right away Then he asked it to call mom and it did that as well Needless to say i had to get one We bought two of these for the kids They love them and I now have an echo dot I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon  i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code nothing then a nother one and still nothing  i started to set up the device at 830 am and by 1120 am i was fed up with it i had to step away after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon  I Like the visual with this echo although I think I would have enjoyed it more if this was my first and only alexa I bought this device for my wife and she loves it Plays videos for cooking 1 on gift list For sure We use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera Works great we tell it to show us the camera and boom there‚Äôs the video feed Super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems However the Amazon hot line was very helpful But who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues All in all I am getting used to the features and like it Alexa runs my entire house The Echo show is a great addition to the Echo family Everyone needs one Staff was very helpful and polite  Went in asked for help and was pointed in the right direction Absolutely love this We got the lights and they have worked so great Great Smart speaker for my 90 year old mother in law I‚Äôm an amazon prime member and the show is awsum I use it to communicate with the son who lives in Seattle You can watch amazon pirime tvplay amazon music Text play games read the lyrics while the song is playing I love it We loved the Echo Dot but the Show is exponentially better Especially love to see the words of the songs being played and views of places all over the world we want to see Big difference in cost between dot and show but worth it Love the new echo show has so many more features that my echo dot I had been looking for the product for a while After much research I bought it and I am not disappointed It is a great product I can tell I wont be bored learning all that the echo show can do If youre thinking about buying it just go for it The Amazon Show is a great addition to the Smart Home easy to set up and to link up with a hub Like having pictures and weather on the screen and news up dates It does everything amazon and I can even see who is at the front door with Arlo It doesnt do Netflix or Hulu but thats okay I really like the sound it fills small rooms Its easy now to video chat with Nana or drop in to tell my kids goodnight when I am working late Facilitates easy home setup of many Smart devices I have really enjoyed these products so much I actually bought 3 of them Fun to watch and even better if you are an Amazon Prime customer for music and video Great electronic  very easy to install me and my family enjoy the things that Alexa do very satisfied with my service that I received from Best Buy when I purchase it looking forward to shopping there more often and Im a new customer there The show has some nice features but the audio quality isn‚Äôt the best for the price point I got mine on sale and am just using it for a bedroom alarm clock I can read the time without my glassesI still use my Sonos Play 1 to listen to my sleep playlist and ny other music Unless I missed something it seems like if I set the volume low at night to listen to music to go to sleep my alarm will not be loud enough So I don‚Äôt use the Show for music much Setting up the amazon show was a little trickybut I managed to navigate through it It‚Äôs so cool to add compatible equipment Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy They also enjoy music on demand Requires too many components Cameras etc stick with basics in my opinion We are loving it so far Bought with a great deal and was able to use previous best buy awards to get it cheap We also ended up buying another one for the parents for Christmas so we can chat back and forth I love how all the echos connect now in our home I am so happy to have the Echo Show I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some When I purchased this item I was unaware how much it really does I can literally control my entire home with it Echo Show is everything I thought it would be and more The alarm and music actions are the greatest We wanted to see how this would work and its not super accurate but kind of fun We have Alexa and now a video version of recipes and more Love it Ok so i normally do not like this kind of stuff but to be honest Alexa has been great not only do we use it for fun stuff like music while cooking or being able to multi task much easier it fit in seamlessly with our home security system added a extra cam and really does add something extra to the home Video integration its big plus for video calling kids at home and quick check whos at the door when doorbell rings The show has a good picture and good soundlove using it to look things up I bought this as a gift As far as know it works fine The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it Like that the music shows the lyrics Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day Everyone in my family loves the camera function sound quality picture resolution and basically everything about itIt isnt totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music pictures videos to having your favorite book read to you One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added Although we have several echo dots everywhere my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud The sound is amazing for its size thats a huge plus Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is its shape Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for I have it connected to our home security system robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone Taken all together it is useful fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home Added screen a great features visual effect a plus We use echo almost every day It is fun to ask questions The music is great We check the weather and listen to NPRnews I picked up the show on a Black Friday deal I probably would never have paid full price I am glad I have the show it is actually quite useful The sound quality is also better than the standard echo At the moment my only complaints are the lack of YouTube support and the price It will be interesting to see what features Amazon will add to the show in the future This is an awesome product This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get 100 off I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both Ive being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time I love all of my Amazon echo devices Right now it doesnt allow YouTube but hopefully they will reach an agreement and fix that I love the show It was so easy to set up I use it every day for music and weather info Cany wait to see how it works for Christmas cookies I am totally AddictedEasy to use Love the call feature The sales associate was knowledgeable enough to lead me in the right direction in purchasing this product that‚Äôs compatible with my mother‚Äôs Arlo Security cameras It works great The first thing we noticed was Alexa‚Äôs response time to questions No waiting or downloading just lightning quick responses 2nd was the compatibility with our smart hone features She connects to our lights and security monitoring system with ease She is clear and concise Product is great It is Easy to use and easy to set up This is a helpful addition to the home Its great to be able to set timers play music and check the news all hands free Alexa can make you crazy but it‚Äôs worth the aggravation This does the same things as the other echos but has a screen The sound is comparable to the echo which is good The screen is small not hd and not touch screen You only can call other echo usersIf you have an echo dont run out and buy you can do all on a laptop If you are looking at an echo having the screen might be worth the extra bucks Upgraded from echo to this and this is just what I needed Works well with my new Ring door bell and security cameras Love the versatility of this Alexa is great and even better with a screen to show you all your searches and videos First bought the Dot to see if we liked it We enjoyed it but wanted a little more volume When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room For larger rooms the Show is a great choice Great product will recommend it to friends and family I was hesitant and I am now hooked This is both fun and useful The Show sounds significantly better than the echo plus And the added screen features are nice I just wish the ‚Äúthings to try section‚Äù would go away This Amazon Echo is very user friendly and provides hours of entertainment with anything from recipes news videos and Amazon music with the lyrics is like having your own Karaoke great product with many functions I would highly recommend it to a friend Device must be studied and practiced with to gain max use of its robust capacity  We bought the Echo Show to get the hyped benefits of Alexa and home automation After using for a week we decided to return the Echo Show Alexa just isnt ready for prime time 90 of the time we got the I cant answer that response to questions Its a waste of money for us Say Alexa Say good bye This product ties in to the Amazon ecosystem better than the Dot or Echo It provides better sound quality and plays video Pairing this off with Nest cameras has been the best So quick and easy I highly recommend this product Alexa can do it all Having a severe hearing loss the Show gives me visuals along with captions so that I can follow what Alexa is saying The Echo show with video screen is a nice upgrade to the other echo‚Äôs News briefs with videos are nice Very good sound quality for playing music This is the only one you need  its like having the Dot Echo and IHome all in one with a screen  So great to instantly see family members to chat demonstrate checkin PLUS all the wonderful features of the Echo devices including video clips movies etc  It is amaizin I like the way you type and search my favorites This has quickly become one of the most used at the kitchen counter If you have Alexa an you like it a must have upgrade This is our second Show And one of several Christmas gifts These are convenient and fun Easy to set up We use our Alexa devices as whole house intercom and for listening to music I use Alexa every day I do not know how I lived with out her before We purchased the Amazon  Echo Show with Alexa in store Took it home and after connection wifi it was great we cannot wait to buy light bulbs and a thermostat Great buy Does exactly what we wanted it to do Very easy voice commands Love this new Echo ShowThe best in the Alexa family Bought the eco show to replace my first gen eco the original tube The show hears and understands me a lot better I love my Alexa Show It can answer most of my questions and I use it for recipes and listening to music I use it everyday The screen is a great upgrade Music lyrics are displayed with good quality speakers Very convenient for recipes and you can make hands free calls with great audio quality Great product I bought the Echo Show because a friend of mine was excited about his Im hoping it makes a great Christmas present for our family I bought the white version and have it in the kitchen I use it for EVERYTHING music video phone security cams news weather Its the perfect kitchen assistant BUY IT The video adds great value to the songs news etcAlso accessing videos such as Netflix adds greatly The echo show feels useless after a few hours especially without the ability to watch YouTube This device is especially useful if you know others who own it It offers the same features as the standard Echo along with an expanded feature set as well My entire family loves this product We ask her questions and go to sleep with her playing music You feel like you have company anytime you want This is a must have is great for recepies while you are cooking Alexa gives you the info For the ines that are used to a tablet or iPod that you have to stop and read this is awesome plus So much easier to follow things Got this for two days during the holidays Very good service Amazon  Echo Show is the best of all my Amazon products I love the handsfree but able to see things on the screen I love this thing It‚Äôs so fun and easy to use My 3 year old even uses it to play the trolls or lion king soundtrack Love having this in my kitchen Play music ask questions make list set timers etc Overall works well Sound better than dot Screen is clear 9the screen doesnt show as much as I thought it would but it works great and the speaker seems good on it I haven‚Äôt used this yet it is a gift for my father but I think he‚Äôll love it I own a dot and a first gen echo and the sound from the show is way better than both of my other echoes The video functions are nice but it is a pain to get it to play videos from my Amazon library My family enjoys the calendar info and the news briefings that rotate on the screen Video calls work great and the screen is super informative I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot Black Friday gave me reason to buy one I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it I may be getting another  Very easy to set up and use Really like the screen to view the items searched for and to read information about the searched item I recommended is very good and practice Play music is very good quality speaker I see video I love Love playing music and talking to Alexa and looking at my camera three the screen This product will for sure come in handy Very easy to use Preciseaccurateand knowledgeable Just an average Alexa option Does show a few things on screen but still limited The amazon Show has to be one of the best smart home devices that every came out Alexa Videos music and drop in Amazing product I had the Echo previously but having the screen opens up more options for Alexa I find it helpful to be able to glance at the screen and see things like time and weather I also have cameras setup and I can use Alexa to view these feeds While the unit is kind of large it is stable and supports touch I havent tried video calling or playing videos but the screen quality seems pretty good Best New Adult Toy in years Wish I had purchased one for my parents LOVE IT I own multiple echoes and I like the show the best The screen adds a lot of value in my opinion I really like being able to see upcoming calendar events and daily news My kids like watching cartoons from Amazon Prime while eating breakfast The speakers are great and put out more than enough quality sound for their size At 149 it was a great deal I bought several Alexa‚Äôs for Christmas gifts also for myself also bought Amazon Show for Christmas gift also for a my youngest Daugter  This one is the bestI have the dots but this is so nice if you have cameras just ask for that camera and you will get it on the screen spend the extra  My wife said I‚Äôm developing a ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù homewhile I‚Äôm still learning what all I can do with this over the regular Echo I am looking forward to getting my Ring Doorbell installed Great product I can rave enough about them A lazy mans drean when it is combined with Alexa If you get the harmony hub you can really impress with home automation I really enjoy my Fire stick Its really easy to use Really cool device Instantly noticed the difference in quality when I switched from the regular Fire Stick to the Fire TV with 4k Love it Works great One in each of the main rooms Works great Turns HA up and down Tv on and off Lights on and off All from Alexa You do have to have apps and special lights I LOVE Alexa and my Echo device and Smart Bulb so much I bought 4 more Echos and 8 more bulbs with more to come soon So I went to the store purchased and giftedit was a snap Love the convenience of being able to turn on a light or other appliances connected to smart switches with voice commands Also very convenient music streaming news and weather reports We replaced our old echo for this one with a smart hub works great It is a nice hub to use with lights and plugs Sometimes echo does not work Speaker was used as a giveaway and everyone wanted it It was a huge hit at our conference Would buy again I bought this for my moms birthday and she loves it I like this smart machine and will recommend to my friends purchased this product while was on sale very easy to pair looks well made very happy with it Love it It‚Äôs a lot of fun Great speakers too provides a lot of great information and fun too Really enjoying this device so farmy smart phone is basic Tracfonecurrently adding smart lightingwill probably switch to a tablet for controlling and adding to a future limited smart home Great item we love our Echo If only she could mow the yard for the kids Alexa walks you through every step which I found helpful We have sonos speakers and a Honeywell Lyric thermostat It took a little searching on google to get things linked Now that they are linked we can play music in any room and change our home temperature by using Alexa Im not a techie but after days of trying to hook up I gave up I dont know if it was the Echo Plus or my carrier ATT Uverse causing the issue but it would NOT connect So back to the store it went Even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistancenone of it worked Alexa Is amazin I love the features their greatJust love it This speaker is truly amazing and being able to control my lights makes it even better My new Echo Plus has been a fun find It is working as advertised and we are still exploring the many many ways you can use this device You do need some tech savvy on apps wifi and willingness to do some reading on the various skills but it is well worth it Already added an Echo Dot to the mix Love the knowledge it gives and easy for my older brother who does It so technology I enjoy the amazon Alexa It is an lot of fun It will be more helpful once I have completely set up I‚Äôve enjoy my echo since I purchased it  The light bulbs are great to I will be buying more products Wanted one for awhile so finally got one Works great Way better than Siri on my iPhone Speaker works great for music Very happy overal These items are easy to set up They have added value to our home Works great I bought 2 1 for the kitchen and 1 for master bath I will definitely recommend this product  The tech support is also easy and friendly Alexa keeps my husband company during the day answering his questions I originally purchased this to use as a Bluetooth speaker for my wifes music but soon realized that we would use this much more than we thought Ya turning on and off lights is good and being able to dim with the included bulb is pretty great but there are hundreds of smart home type of apps that work with this including my Sony Google TV and more show up regularly Makes it almost too easy to be lazy Pretty fun little gadget Kids love playing with it Not even sure of all the things it can do yet I am extremely satisfied with my purchaseNew toy Bought 4 devices for my kids they report its simple to start up easy to use and fun The ultimate lazy life is happening before my eyes Now I love technology  always have  But let‚Äôs be honest  telling Alexa to turn the lights off and on and ask her to tell you a joke as examples  It really is great and I‚Äôm now addicted to the Hue line as well Alexa ricks the plus is the best ever buy it you will love it Have yet to explore all the aspects Enjoy using it daily It is so fun to talk to Alexa the sound is also very high quality I am very happy with my purchase One of my favorite purchases Very easy to set up Already works with Dish hope Directv gets it soon I saw this product used by friends and was so impressed I bought one for my husband for Christmas  Love being able to turn a light on when I walk inside with no hands Alexa is a lifesaver So far I have used Alexa to play music My only comment would be that I wish there was a larger variety of opera music bought this as a present for the wife but as I relaxed for the holiday requested six hours of different song play The wife enjoyed the music as the music emanated through the open areas of our house The wife received information on measures for recipes weather updates etc this will be one of those classic gifts Echo is nice but it could be better allowing you to connect to anything that is on your WIFI network without having to buy several different hubs I need to buy all the additional parts but it‚Äôs great I have enjoyed learning about home automation using Echo plus and consumers need to know that this comes with having to buy additional equipment to get the most out of Alexa I love this product I love everything about it I have two dots and this and the functionality between them is awesome I can‚Äôt wait to see how it improves through time Great quality speaker and build Really enjoy having the echo to use to control the lights and music in our house Wife loves her Alexa Uses it with her pandora and the kids love talking to it I love Alexa although sometimes she has a hard time understanding so I find myself repeating commands such as ‚ÄúAlexa turn off lights in bedroom‚Äù  Overall she‚Äôs amazing and she tells jokes and very up to date with current events We have several this one was a Christmas gift for our daughter We love the convenience of creating lists and some home automation Once you get started you come up with more things to use it for Great way to introduce family and friends to AI Technology this is my third Alexa and combined with my fire TV and now the lights my couch time has increased Love the new technology What an amazing piece of technology I was impressed with the sound quality I bought it for my family and everyone loves it Definitely recommend buying one I gave as a gift to my kids for Christmas they are enjoying Alexa This was a present for my mother very fun She loves looking things up and its easier to talk it out Alexa is amazing and the Phillips bulb works seamlessly with it This is such a great addition to our house Amazon Echo plus is incredible for all the things it is capable of doing We use Alexa to ask simple questions like  what time is the basketball game and she usually responds correctly If you ask a more detailed question she may not have an answer We like to play Jeopardy and listen to local radio stations using Alexa I am sure the device will get better with more use and updates Decided to go for the model just below this one I didnt need the integrated hub features Phillips Hue does require this but I decided to stick with my current Insteon hub I love this product and it was one of my Best Buy‚Äôs from best buy Waste of money ask Alexa a question and you are lucky if you get an answer instead of Im not sure I love how Alexa can control almost all smart things and help control lights and power on and off devices to help us get ready for the day The music is connected directly to Amazon Prime Music and I love how the sound is clear and crisp You can call out to Alexa from far away and she‚Äôll add items to your shopping list and the Alexa app is so simple to view the lists and control your smart things I have an Echo that I bought from Best Buy several months ago So when it came to buying one for my son  his family for Christmas I knew where to come It‚Äôs an excellent information hub Perfect start for smart homeworks perfect with Echo I take 1 star off because I had problems to syncing it with my WFI This was a great purchase I love my echo plus with the hue light bulb The set up is really easy and you can hook up your amazon account and order from Alexa You can program your lights to be turned on at a certain time every day or even download the app and turn them on remotely I love how this product is compatible with nest products Good stereo sound but will not control some devices without the use of an external hub Easy to use no Complains at all Added all the smart plugs to the skills and works perfect This is my first Amazon Echo and it was a great buy The Echo Plus works amazing The voice control of the lights in my house works perfect No need for a hub I love having Alexa in my home Alexa has helped from recipes to relaxing sleep sounds all night Purchased my first Amazon Echo Plus after researching online and watching video reviews A friend of mine had one and he showed me the features The device was easy to setup and has worked great since I use it to control lights fans and play music Having a great experience using the Alexa Echo plus product Pleased with Alexa Have not used light yet I‚Äôll update after use Love my Alexa Having lots of fun asking her questions and enjoy listening to music on it I also have the smaller echo and this sounds much better Love all the features They are both responsive to each other and it gives me convenience I dont have to turn off the lights and all I do is lay down and ask Alexa to turn off the light All my lights are connected to my Echo Plus My family have enjoyed ALEXA in the house she is very smart and she does lots of research for the family We are truly glad that we made the purchase Great entertainment when friends are over The knowledge and jokes are tons of fun This is the second one I‚Äôve bought this year for gifts This Alexa series 2 sounds better and preforms better than the previous model It picks up the voices 10x better and the sound quality is on a Bose levelfills the whole room Me and my family spends more quality time on the product I have had the competitive products and nothing compares Alexis is the new favorite name Great for the college student Great Echo Friend really liked it It really does what he wants it to do and he connected his lights to the device Everything works well So far so good I enjoy being able to communicate with friends and family using the Drop In Feature Alexa a great product the light too They are working fine Great sound for the money Easy to set up also have a dot that I like Love the sound I have a google home and is not as loud as this echo A must have Everyone should get one great sound  easy to use wife love it connect with wifi and all my phones and practical easy to use just the start of my IOT home We love our Alexia We mostly use it for music and to control the lights Very pleased to have this new Echo Plus and get started on automation of the home in stages Knowing that it can continue to improve with new products and apps is a plus for owning this device Bought one for Living Room and the other for the bedroom Home wifi needs to be boosted but Alexa would connect through out which caused complications along with Bluetooth speakers Once straightened out works great I have no idea how my family ever lived without these products Since purchasing the Alexa Hub and Hue bulb weve purchased Echo Dots for our kitchen and sons room We absolutely love the convenience of the bulbs and Alexa is a life saver on so many levels This was a present for my husband who originally had asked for a radio for his home office He set it up relatively quick and was amazed at the sound quality He loved the versatility and that he could have a specific radio station played or a random song as well as tell a joke etc It has been fun for all of us and we are looking into getting the smaller dots for other rooms now He commented that he would NEVER get rid of this Its very fun and functional The Smart bulb is very handy as well Love it I have been contemplating purchasing an Echo product for some time now I finally did it and I am so pleased I did It was extremely easy to set up I add my lights to the process and now it is so easy to turn lights on before I get to the room For me I know this will be the tip of the iceberg I will now start looking at what else I can add to the Echo Love the product Great Buy I got this for my husband He likes it and the setup is easy I wasnt sure I would use this item when I purchased it for my family However I just signed up for Amazon unlimited music after testing it on radio stations and playing games with the grandkids I want to hook up the lighting feature as well Speaker is excellent quality and quite enjoyable to listen to I really enjoy the Echo plus Speaker sorry bds good for playing music and I enjoy having Alexa turn on my lights Works great very easy to install made connecting other devices even easier A wonderful use of creativity and design where installation was a breeze and use was pure enjoyment I purchased this as a second Alexa Couldnt figure out why it came with the Hue Light bulb until I learned that the new version of Alexa has a builtin hub Its a gift for my spouse but I cant wait to set it up and get more bulbs to automate our home lighting Great addition to all the other electronics in our home Bought the Amazon  Echo Plus  Philips Hue Bulb  Black for my kitchen it is awesome also came with free smart bulb Love my Echo Plus echo echo spot and Ech show Very satisfied with the products

with these purchases and learning so much with Alexa You can start your daily routine with Alexa and program it to whatever you would like to include news weather music horoscope ALSO you can start your day off with a compliment and I think is very important Alexa gave me the BEST CHILI RECIPE I MEAN THE BEST it‚Äôs called Chili I I want my husband to use Alexa to stay organized for business dates and reminders This is the way to go I think these products are great I enjoy using them Great sound and function ‚ù§Ô∏è Alexa The color and style of the silver plus looks great with our newly finished basement Very good price for the product Sounds good and fun and easy to set up Still seeing if if I like alexa like to try and set up lighting Love the shopping lists feature listening to music  having so much fun I have several Amazon Echos throughout my house Home automation is great and these work with everything that I have This is a great product but we exchanged the unit for the 2nd generation because of space limitations It works great too Have 1st gen Echo and Dot and a 2nd gen Dot Wanted this over regular Echo because I prefer the look and better speakers Since installing the Amazon Echo we have been having fun with talking to Alexa Also the music feature is great I had my doubts when I first purchased it But after just a day I had synced it with my thermostat lights TV Bose sound system and many more Amazing product couldn‚Äôt be happier Great device but I noticed based on the WiFi connection that Alexa can react slower at times Especially when asking the device to turn off bulbs or any smart devices Its nice to be able to listen to music in the morning and setting reminders is extremely helpful and I love being able to operate my light bulb remotely Took it out of the box and played with it for a while Then I lost connection with it and now it no longer recognizes my phone  Called Amazon they said they would work on the problem no call back yet Great and easy even for someone that is not tech savvy Echo Plus is everything I expected and more Plus easy to set up GREAT PRICE FOR HOLIDAYS COMBO WORKS WELL NO NEED FOR EXTERNAL HUB Hard to review as I purchased for my son as a present The bundle will help to test Philips hue light Purchased additional tplink plug It is an ok device but I find Google home to be better and more promising in the future Love love love my echo plus Is great that it has a built in bridgegreat way to start a system for your smart homeLove being able to program lights to come on and off from phone This Echo has great sound for such a a small device It is easy to set up and use I am finding new tasks Alexa can do each day I bought this for my mom and dad they loved it Thank you So yesterday evening i decided to purchase an Amazon Echo Is the machine intrusive yeah i guess it could be if you allow it I purchased it because of its home automation and other fantastic capabilities Just to name a few of those capabilities With a subscription you will have an unprecedented amount of music you can listen to that in itself was worth it Some other things include sports travel recipes and traffic The home automation part lock doors turn on lights random lighting when on vacation We love Alexa Great addition to our family Lol But seriously you can rely on Alexa Alexa turns on the lights and when I say

Live walking into a room and asking Alexa to turn on a light Poof it‚Äôs done Or locking and unlocking the front door Arming and disarming my security system If you‚Äôre looking to turn your house into a smarthome I strongly recommend the Amazon Echo Plus Received an Echo Plus as a Christmas present Absolutely love it We went back  purchased a Dot  more light bulbs Salesman told me the big one was better so I bought it My daughter gave me the small one for Christmas Does the same thing Salesmen are apparently undertrained or a bunch of liars I love this product and plan to expand my Alexa and Echo network Purchased as a gift for the family Can‚Äôt wait to use it I already had the 1st gen Echo This one has considerably more options that I can use I highly recommend this item Is a notch up product with inbuilt hub echo has opened up the door for easy connectivity with other products If you like to control smart gadgets this is definitely for you Gave it as a gift to provide a sense of safety and security for someone living in the country Turning the lights on before entering the house is a big deal when you live alone The Echo Plus was demonstrated for us at Best Buy We were a bit skeptical but bought to check it out Wow are we impressed We tell it to turn on and turn off our lights in the living room family room and bedroom Also it can dim the lights more than once Need the local weather forecast just ask Want to listen to Christmas music Yes again Want to know the distance to someplace or the population of some city or country yes Were still discovering what it can do and it seems limitless Absolutely love this This does not give great answers and the connection is not that great Exchanging for a GOOGLE Home We all love ALEXA You can play games like Jeopardy or would you rather family edition The kids love to have Alexa tell them jokes Alexa Exceed expectations in it ability to control Ive had an Amazon Echo and Dot for over a year now I really wanted to develop the Smart Device usage around my house and when the upgraded Echo i just had to have it It is a great device I use the drop in feature to communicate with others in the house especially when they are upstairs without having to yell The smart hub is amazing Attaching to smart devices is much more seamless than with the 1st gen echo Just got it so time will tell but the 2nd gen Echo devices are worth it Works great with WeMo and Philips Hue Great sound and voice recognition Loud speaker very responsive Makes it easier that the smart hub is built into it than having to buy another piece of equipment Very easy to set up I mostly control the lights with my Hue cell phone app Very convenient I have 4 lamps hooked up to the light bulbs now I plan on doing most of my house in the future I listen to music and get weather updates from the Echo My husband uses the echo as an alarm We the concept to learn and adapt to the ever changing word This product should stand out I love that I have the ability to catch up on news and have this crazy thing turn on and off my lights Love it It has very good voice recognition even with the grandchildren throwing all kinds of crazy questions at it Speaker quality is top of the line Everyone that has tried it out at our house loves it The Echo is a great addition for my busy household The voice commands to play music is excellent The fact I can sit on my couch and control the lights and other items just by saying what i want is just amazing I love Alexa Great sound unlimited music used the bulb and synchronized itSimple 2 use Very easy to setup Had no issues at all  Nice having hub inside  Bulb sync was a breeze I bought this and an Echo Dot just in case the Dot didnt do everything I needed The Dot worked fine so I returned the fullfeatured Echo Plus Upgraded to the Plus with a lot of the accessories We returned it Could not give answers to our questions even though the answers were easily found on google This is a great entry level Alexa product The speaker is adequate but the inclusion of the Philip‚Äôs hue bulb makes it feel like a good deal This was an awesome gift for someone very special and they enjoy it as much as I do mine would recommend product You are able to control you lights and other electrical devices with the Echo Plus I truly love this item its amszing good  Will do This Alexs device is fantastic and would recommend it for anyone Especially for people with physical disabilities We are enjoying all of its features Had the Echo Plus over a week and this thing is amazing Great sound and easy to move around A little tricky with the set up but works great Easy set up and very user friendly for my children My DIL loves it Does everything she had read about My grandson is a bit disappointed that Alexa cant carry on a conversation LOL However he is only 8 Purchased this for my wife All the lights are now voice activated The sound it great from the built in speaker awesome product my wife and I love it makes home automation simple We finally decided to try the Echo system after months and months of debate We purchased the Echo Plus  an Echo Dot The Plus easily handles our main two floors and the Dot handles our upstairs The Pluss speakers are incredible for its size We both agree we made the right choice to get the Plus I bought this for my brother and his wife They love it Not only does it control their Nest thermostat it works with their expanding environment of Philips Hue bulbs works like a dreamuse it dailyphone feature is really coollike it Smart HomeHappy HomeThis lightbulb is simpleall you need to do is speak to it A perfect gift for someone who has everything and a busy schedule Purchased the product for a gift Has not been used yet We have two echo ourselves and purchased this as a gift for someone We have smart plugs for our lamps that Alexa turns onoff It made a great Christmas present for my wife PlusI get it tooWorks great Great order and delivery from Best Buy Great item for controling your lights in my home even when Im away This is our first Echo so nothing to compare it to but so far so good Sound is great Fun to use and has been helpful for information needed quickly The echo is great for choosing music and getting information The voice is very soothing Easy to set up Performs well Nice Product For The Money Bought this Echo for my wife She loves how just by speaking she can listen to any type of music It sounds pretty good too I purchased my Eco for the holidays It took me considerable time to get minimally operational It is rather complex to hook up to other devises So far it is only hooked up to my Dot I wish there were more varieties of ways to learn how to use it I am not nearly able to make use of it yet Butit does look exciting if I ever get there The built in hue allows the echo plus to automatically search and finds connectable devices The larger speaker area assists in better sound and the alexa to hear my voice I love AlexaShe has become my best friend Thanks Kind of hard adding smart items but when you do it‚Äôs nice to just talk and not get on computer or smart phone to control I really enjoy the sound It sounds so full My only disappointment is the limited functionality of the built in hub I had to purchase the Hue Hub to get full functionality Other than that I love it Great Christmas gift The hubby loved it  Just read the manual before setting up Its awesome Feels like company Takes commands on the first try and the sound fills the room beautifully My guests love it too No complaints easy and extremely fun to use Alexa can do it all Bought an echo plus and it has been better than I expected Primarily use it for music in the LR but we are starting to use it for other functions such as the weather and playing jeopardy Love this combination package I got while on sale Amazon Echo Plus is responsive and easy to use Great sound quality Easy to integrate with other services such as the Hue Bulb Just need to get more bulbs to complete my setup I like being able to turn on lights music and the thermostat in our home Alexa is awesome to have at home makes things fun and easy I have an Amazon Prime account so I started downloading apps and playing all kinds of music on this I also can control my Hue hub you need one for certain timers and things and Wemo plus outlets for my non wifi lights and LEDs in the kitchen cabinets I bought this for my Mom for Christmas and ended up she got me one too Great for everyone speaker sounds great easy to set up and my Mom ended up getting the dot so she could have her light turned on from downstairs and then tell Alexa to turn it off while in bed No regrets on this one I gave the Echo 5 stars but I like Amazon products and ultimately the product is goodhowever I use Cree smart light bulbs in my house and bought this Echo for the built in Hub to try and eliminate the extra hub space in my housebut the built in hub of the Echo Plus isn‚Äôt compatible at this time with Cree light bulbsso I had to return it and wait for now and stick with my regular Echo and Echo Dot‚Äôs Love the echo plus Easy to set up with comparable extras has simplified so many things in my home Takes some getting to use to but patience and practice and males all the difference The first one was not working so we had to take it back and get a new one Great product Didnt realize it‚Äôs compatible with different items We use Alexa for so many things We use it for shopping list music lights on or off even Trivia games Christmas gift for my son and my husband Can‚Äôt wait to hook it up Works great and we like like the light that came with it Not one issues so far My wife and I love the Amazon echo plus it‚Äôs very easy to control the hue lights in the house that we have set up I would recommend this to anybody we love it We also play a lot of music on it We never received the light bulb Very happy with Alexa just not happy that the bulb was not sent It has very limited use without adding on expensive Apps or adding more wireless speakers I am considering returning the merchandise Bought this for my son and one for my husband and me So easy to set up Very helpful Doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of space When I used to think of amazon echo I think flimsy sounds Amazon Echo was more of ECHOIng tin can complex at least from what I have experienced with my friends echos Echo Plus you ask Not so much This device has such excellent sound One of the best devices I have ever purchased If I could I would have these all over my house Forget the dot and the echo 2nd gen Echo plus is the way to go Beautiful device sounds is second to none Went to my local Best Buy and a friendly employee greed me and ask me if I needed any help I ask about the echo and the google assistance and the employee explained the pros and cons of each device and even show me other ones With his help I end up pickin the new echo Plus Alexa and I absolutely LOVE IT I really like the Phillips Hue Bulb included and I am definitely going to buy more My customer experience was really great and I am very grateful for the courtesy knowledge and the time this employee offered me This experience make me want to come back to this same store for all my needs specially because they can help me choose wisely Love my Alexa and love the hue bulb Now I will be going to buy a new smart tv to control with Alexa next Great customer service Thank you Purchased the Echo Plus after reading that the new generation had been upgraded by improving the sound and integration of a controller For the price provided I thought that the deal was a good value I have the first generation unit as well A quick comparison of the two from a sound look etc perspective really didnt lead me to think that there was any noticeable sound improvement nor improved aesthetics At least the price for the unit has come down quite a bit and the addition of Philips bulb for free was a smart moveOverall I think that the unit is a good purchase for beginning some home automation projects I was really reluctant buying Alexa but I‚Äôve read so much about this item that I bought the package Alexa and Phillips bulb and have been amazed with how well it works Worked right out of the box easy set up and operation Love the thing My wife uses it daily Should have bought it a long time ago It even controls our Hue lights Purchased the echo after hearing it at a neighbors Good quality speaker for the small size The system is able to react quickly to the verbal directions It even is able to pickup voices across the room and seems to capture the commands accurately even when spoken quickly Got one for my daughter last year and she loves it I had 3 dots and decided to get the echo plus Great product so far Controls my hue lights Grandkids love asking it questions Great device Good speaker very solid feeling Microphones listen well I have the Echo plus and i love it the speakers sounds loud and clear Bought for my husband for Christmas We keep it in our kitchen and mainly just use it for music But our kids love that they can tell Alexa to play a song they like and it plays I really like the echo plus and the hue light bulb does work on the echo plus but I had to buy a bridge from Phillips in order to schedule on off schedule times for the light I thought the Echo Plus was like a bridge but I guess it isn‚Äôt One For Us One For The Kids For ChristmasGreat way to get connected This Amazon Echo is the COOLEST gadget you can buy it is VERY SMART and learns very fast it runs many items in our home IE Nest LG TV Lights The device is extremely useful for all those who choose to have a smartconnected home The builtin hub helps you to connect your devices easier than not having it I would recommend this device especially if you have a prime membership This is a very neat item Love all the things this can do Speaker has great sound and it‚Äôs awsome that it syncs with other speakers to really fill your house with sound The smart lights I wasn‚Äôt too sure of but since I‚Äôve installed it I want to get more It‚Äôs a great smarthome hub This is my second Alexa and the second time set up so much easier I love the extra volume for my music and the peer to peer calling gives me a mini hands free intercom Still discovering the new features I loved my echo so much I bought my sister one I can now turn on my lights when I get home just by asking Alexa Is great fun useful Great speaker Kids love it I really like how she is able to interact and plays music with great sound She interacts with my smart home Got this model only because of the sale price and the built in hub that controls my hue strip lights AndI didn‚Äôt want to say google all the time Sounds like baby talk to melol Echo Plus has everything the old Echo had plus better sound and builtin capability for Smart Home addons like Hue bulbs and SmartThings plugs ‚Äî without needing a Hue hub or ST hub Love it I am not a tech person but I was able to easily connect these devices to my network This was out first time using any of Amazons alexa products and we love it So far we have the hue light bulbs and fire stick but plan on updating the front door lock and thermostat So easy to use and convenient Very easy to set up Easy to connect with multiple Amazon Echo Dots as well as multiple smart home products Worked fine first time out of the box Plug it in set it up with you Amazon account and you are ready to go It is very convenient to turn on and off the Phillips light by voice I love being able to use Alexa She is an amazing AI Until the robots rebel against the human kind I think it‚Äôs worth it this was a great purchase with one hue bulb included with the echo plus Installationset up was a breeze This ia a great product more technology to make your life easier This works perfectly for the smart home connecting to all your devices Coupled with Amazon prime this has it all Voice speaker clearly understands you from up close and from across the house Definitely recommend to anyone that wants a exciting product Alexa is fun to play with for the whole family and it fills the house with music when not telling us a joke Great product easier set up than anticipated Actually bought for my Mother  she loves it I love amazon products easy to use and install I recommend them 100 very good sound and above all price I like being able to ask about the weather set an alarm on my phone or create a shopping list all by just asking Elexia From her jokes rapping and everyday new fact Alexa is awesome Its super easy to pull out your phone to check the weather but i honestly never did and would always be surprised when i walked outside with whatever it is that day But every morning i ask alexa whats the weather and she gives me an in depth review for that day and the rest of the week There are tons of skills for Alexa most useful some random But shes a must try Also plus about the echo plus is if you want to start a smart home you dont need a hub like the other echo pieces You can just buy some compatible smart bulbs You need to have Amazone prime in order to have music Works great Can‚Äôt wait to find all it can do for me Asking trivia questions of Alexa is a hoot but being able to turn off the ceiling fan from bed is golden Builtin hub only lets your control Philips Hue with your voice You still need the Philips Hue hub to be able to use the Hue app I ended up buying the Hue hub as well Has better speaker than the regular Echo Great product easy to use and would recommend to anyone I really like this product My Son got us the Alexa Show for Christmas and I wanted one that would turn on lights and other items So we purchased this because it has the bridge so that you can use it with the Phillips Hue lights It works great I have the Show in the kitchen and I have the Echo in my bedroom I love that it has a great built in speaker I can have it play my music in both rooms at the same time Bought for a family memeber and he was so happy with the game I purchase one for my children and us is a great way to stay connected and smart to have it at home Alexa really amazes me She learns new skills everyday I‚Äôm still trying to get it set up but so far it‚Äôs a blast We like using the Echo Probably didnt need the plus because we are just using it to play music on Amazon music I was skeptical about the Amazon Echo products Why would I need this I bought the Echo Dot first and was hooked Bought this Echo Plus for smart home integration Since then I have bought a bunch of smart bulbs and plan on more things I bought an Echo Spot too You do not need an Echo product but they are fun practical and cool Cant live without it now A fun little device on the cutting edge of consumer artificial intelligence Sp aker sounds pretty good Alexa does have some problems understanding how I ask questions a fair amount of the time I was wishing I good set it up to my pool equipment Excellent item above and beyond my expectations It works great and is easy too use The salesman was a tremendous help I bought this for myself and another one for a gift you must have WiFi to use as well as a smart phone Good product and wasy to set up Works well with smart lights This is great for inquisitive minds Alexa plays music turns the light on answers questions and so much more ECHO PLUS OFFERS SO MUCH MORE FOR THE SMART HOME HOWEVER I HAVE HAD THE DOT FOR A LONG TIME AND YESTERDAY I BOUGHT 5 ECHO DOTS FOR MY CHILDREN GREAT PRODUCT great sound Love the music and the electrical devices you can work with it My home is about 80 automated with help from ALEXAWe want to have one in each room I really purchased this for my wife to use as a Bluetooth speaker knowing that maybe we would find something else for it to do Im glad I did now We have Christmas tree lights going off and on lamps dimming at precise measures Alexa light 30 percent and am looking at the other many many things that this can do Its easy to setup too Easy to set up We really enjoy getting real time local weather It translates Spanish very efficiently We also enjoy the music we can easily select but would appreciate a higher quality sound Linking the Echo to lighting is a snap Highly recommended LOVE it Never had one before Easy to set up and use Alexa works pretty good music sounds good Just exploring all her skills i have really enjoyed my new echo plusi enjoy music every morning with the news Bought this for our son for Christmas He uses it in his room and loves it Alexa also wakes him up for school in the morning this is so much better than the echo dot the smart hub is pretty cool Awesome product and cool design and a great color I would recommend to a friend I already have Alexa at home and since it was on sale made a nice christmas gift It works well and sounds decent but the hub portion of this is not as easy to use as Samsung This was a gift that I gave to my daughter at our family Christmas party She loves it especially the ease of set up and the attached hub so she can control her lights  her nest thermostat This has also gone over well with the Grand Children Echo plus seems to work as they say I have it running two lights so far Plan on setting up seven more Nice product Alexa items are easy to use and set up Works easily with the smart plug and bulb This is the music lovers best friend My wife and kids love asking Alexa to play ANY song The sound quality is great Seamlessly control your house tell Alexa to turn on your favorite music and play games Not much else you could ask for especially for the price I received an original echo two years ago and use it in my office This year I decided to get one for the house and was amazed at all the features I hadn‚Äôt taken advantage of Primarily the smart home features This was great because it came with a lightbulb I was a bit reluctant to jump on the Alexa wagon but now that I have I don‚Äôt know why This is awesome Still figuring out all the things I can do but only because there are so many This will be a great gift for the whole house too enjoy Works seamlessly and easy to set up and use A great product This product is so very convenient I have day I dont want to get up and she helps me My kids like to play music I like the online

patterns Sound quality is very good  Sleek design is nice We bought this for our son who wanted nothing for christmas he uses it all the time With lights music and locking the door He absolutely loves it We are now buying another home base for the rest of the house Works great used to put the lights on when I was in Texas during the holidays A great value and I love it sounds great and works Saw Echo dot at my parents Had to have one Then I saw the plus It was so easy to set up Love the the music steaming Love the light bulb that came with mine Makes my life so much easier when I don‚Äôt have an empty hand Guess what I went back and bought one for my sister for Christmas Very pleased The Echo Plus is an Awesome Device Lots of information just by speech Quite satisfied w purchase  However paying 50 dollars for a smart bulb has proven to be a superfluous expense  Very helpful for someone with disabilities Saves a lot stepsResponsive and fun to use Best Buy associate explained product very well Easy to use I bought this for my wife and absolutely loves it Alexa is so smart and helps my wife with everything Like a personal assistant Love the Alexa Very convenient to use to listen to music and turn on my lights Bought this for my parents to use with their Amazon prime account Sure they will love it Wanted to expand Alexa into multiple rooms of the house This device added easily into the system and can now listen to music in multiple rooms I purchase the Echo Plus as a Christmas gift but set it up early so that it could be used right out of the box I was impressed how easy the setup was Ill find out later how it sounds and works This is the bestfast to play music and check weather and lots of other questions Nice smart speaker I do wish there was a LG TV Alexa skill My new Echo Plus exceeds my expectations The speakers sound is just what I wanted and the included Hue bulb is great We already have the Echo in our house I got this for my son for his apartment and he loves it received as a Christmas gift really works well we can turn the living room light on and off from anywhere with cell phone so you dont need to remember to plug in a timer when going away plays amazon music and sound is amazing I purchased it to control my lights  introduce myself to Alexa  AI but I find myself using it for all sorts of things and enjoy using it I can now control my front door Arlo camera by asking Alexa to show the live feed in to my TV and get my Robots vacuum cleaner to start work  plus listen to the latest weather conditions  do my normal google search via Alexa  I am seriously hooked in to my Alexa Love it so far but I have a lot to learn yet My son loves it also This product is great Still finding out everything that it can do but completely satisfied Would be so much better if it had an internal battery I enjoyed and I bought an echo too To make all my family take the pleasure of it Definitely worth the money The sound is awesome my wife loves alexa it was an early Christmas present So far I love the echo products I ended up buying a combination of 8 for Christmas gifts I have both a 1st gen Echo and now the new Echo Plus I am impressed with the sound quality improvement especially the bass Don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs no Bose system but it sounds great for every day use Very pleased Based upon reviews I did expect the speaker to be louder and have a bit better sound but not a big deal For big sound just turn on the stereo My family Loves this My 3 boys love asking alexa to tell a joke or to make toot noises Its super helpful in with news and weather updates Easy to set up easy to use apps are awesome and sounds great I absolutely love this product It does so many things not the least of which is music Ask it anything and it will answer Sound is amazing Wish Alexa knew more things I get a lot of I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt know that which is unfortunate Purchased the Echo Plus and couldnt be more pleased Easy to use On sale  was purchased as a gift for Christmas really great deal Love the concept and how I can make my whole house a smart house Decent sounding music deviceeasy to connect and use the app Getting custom routines set up with smart home vivint hue etc takes some trial and error figuring out commands Would buy again Really enjoy the Echo Plus this is a must have for all homes So far the Echo has been extreme useful My husband just says start my day in the morning and it gives him the weather and traffic before he leaves for work It is also is nice to tell it to turn on and off lights in the home with the smart bulbs Overall Im extremely satisfied with my Echo plus I bought this for my 14 year old daughter and she loves it This amazon Alexa plus is awesomeit‚Äôs works great and easy to set up Love this product I can ask questions and play musicalso link my lights to it I am so glad that I bought this Echo it has made it easier to automate my music and my lights throughout my house We are still learning to use it but hope to add our thermostat as well to the items I can control with my Alexa Not sure It was a gift Well be setting up after Christmas This is the first Echo that we have used and really like it It is easy to set up according to my husband There are things that we would like to do but dont have instructions on how to do them Echo plus is great for home use to ask questions and turn the lights on when you away I am not the most tech savvy person and found this very easy to get set up without any help It great to have in the home it has become invaluable Excellent combination and easy to install and setup When I tried to hook it up it wouldnt recognize my internet I will have to contact best buy when I get home and have their guys come out to see if they can get it working Surprisingly entertaining and a diverse selection of apps make for a fun addition to the house Adding lights and enabled plugs adds to the fun and practicality as well Set up was simple We liked so much we bought one for my Mom Great product I use it everyday It‚Äôs a great way to automate your home Very happy with amazon not hesitating to integrate their products with third party integration‚ÄùCrestron I looked at Google Home  And the Echo I went with the Echo after I spoke to a Best Buy employee They helped me sort out the pros and cons I do love all the skills that are possible Its like another person in my apt sometimes I live alone the Echo adjusts my lights and plays my Pandora Im pretty much loving it I love my echo so easy to hook up and great sound quality It‚Äôs easily connected to my Sony android tv and works great I didn‚Äôt know what I was missing out on until I got an Echo Plus Purchased the Echo Plus because of the built in Zigbee hub It controls my Philips Hue bulbs throughout the house very easy setup Speaker is sufficient for the area I have it in I‚Äôve been hesitant to purchase this item didn‚Äôt feel there was an actual need Alexa has changed my mind I use this daily with timers and turning off appliances checking weather and adjusting my heat Alexa can even arm the alarm system Great sound quality Easy to set up Easy to use Looks good too Let there be light  this has been awesome to be able to walk in to a room and with a spoken word from me have the light go on Equally impressive is that it gradually goes bright so you aren‚Äôt blinded by it Eco plus is an amazing product it integrates with most of the productsU can set the music reminders buy products what notdefinitely a worthy purchase Setting this up was about as easy as one could expect The Echo Plus is an amazing device and I got a free smart light bulb with a package deal  You simply must have a virtual voice activated assistant I can not recommend this product enough If you don‚Äôt have one you will eventually If you can‚Äôt afford you you aren‚Äôt a Big Baller Easy to set up and pair other compatible items by enabling skills through the Amazon app Ive been to best buy twice for information and how to questions and all seems to be going well Its only been a week and still have a lot to learn about Elexas capabilities I love my amazon echo plus as bad as it sounds I don‚Äôt have to get out of bed to turn the lights off my fans on or off and even my tv We love alexa I really like this device Right now I only have 1 light syncd with it but looking forward to adding more Another feature I like is the ability to put items on both my shopping and errand lists I cant wait to find out all the things it can do for me As a newbie in smart home technology I was attracted to the Echo Plus because of the builtin Zigbee hub which means it can connect directly to products like the Philips Hue line of smart bulbs without the need for a separate smart hub Combine that with the power of Alexa voice commands and I was able to get my smart home up and running in a matter of minutes I bought this for my financei bought it for Christmas he left bed it Sound and response is good Works well for area coverage The echo plus is the way to go and with the hue no need to install a dimmer The echo plus has been great easy to set up and workits all I thought it would be and more love it Love operation of this systemBought the mini afterwards for another room I wondered about buying one before making the decision  now even after just a few weeks I wonder how I managed It has some gimmicky things yes but also can help out with a lot of very useful ideas such as weather traffic and lists Would recommend one to anyone Bought eh Echo Plus on a whim  it was on sale and I figured why not I am really enjoying it Apart form the basic news and weather reporting I enjoy my morning trivia I also use the music from Amazon a lot Its been nice having a holiday station at my disposal The Echo Plus is easy to set up and use and definitely has a lot of features many of which I am still learning Love this product super easy to use and able to have a lot of fun with this with entertaining guests and ourselves It has great speakers and is very easy to set up love my echo Bought this for my mom that is electronically challenged and she loves it Makes her feel like she is a tech wiz Makes me feel better about her ability to turn lights on and off as she comes and goes More importantly she is in her 70s and Iives alone she can make a phone call using Alexa from anywhere she has an echo I bought her 3 to cover her whole house This means if she falls down and can‚Äôt get to her phone she can dial me or 911 with her voicea must have Still figuring out what all I can do with it but the Echo was extremely easy to hook up The instructions that came with it made everything very clear The speaker doesnt get room filling loud if you want to play music but thankfully it has an audio out jack so I just hooked it up to some speakers Surprisingly useful Ben 2 Echo is much better than Gen 1 Definitely recommend We love the new Echo So easy to set up and use Alexa usually works well but it has turned on things when I did not tell it to its a lot of fun playing with alexa comands the speakers sound great im glad i purchase it I love this product would really recommend to any one Love being able to set a timer play music and turn in my WiFi connected lamp without moving from my couch This has got to be the best electronic purchase I‚Äôve made in recent months Easy to set up so many skills to enable Alexa knows it all The range is about 30 feet for it to hear and recognize my voice Be sure to speak clearly Great purchase and exceeds my expectations Works great with my iOS devices too This may be an incremental upgrade to the original Amazon Echo but is definitely worth it Miles ahead from Google Home As I made my home a smart home I know I know I made a smart choice with Amazon Echo and Philips light bulbs Im looking forward to adding more smart gadgets to my collection The light came free with the Echo didn‚Äôt know but now that I have that one I want to get all my lights like this one It‚Äôs so great and convenient to be able to tell it to turn off right before I leave the room instead of having to walk over there to pull the cord Or even better when you forget to turn the switch off before you sit down that‚Äôs the worst Love asking Alexis all kinds of questions and listening to great Amazon Music Very easy to set upChanged how I do a lot of things Pretty cool productFeatures are limited unless you spend a lot more money buying other things you can connect and interface with But the basic unit with one lightbulb is a pretty good start Just know going into it that you will be shelling out a lot more to expand the system The sound of the Echo Plus is good and the matte black color looks stylish The Phillips Hugh Bulb that was included with my purchase is nice and convenient Purchased as a gift for my 14 year old son He absolutely loves it Uses to place music ask questions and turn off his lights Still learning what all she can do but it definitely makes life easier She could perform some tasks but most things she didnt know So agrivating We love the Echo II Its an awesome product Great price too My husband loves the ability to listen to anything and to be able to run the living room light when he comes in instead of trying to find the light switch I have been greatly impressed with the Alexa A friend loves calling me and asking her Alexa questions We share alot of laughs just discovering all the things she can do So I just had to purchase an Alexa for myself Im just beginning set my Alexa up I hope its easy because Im not tech salve Ive got to go and get started with the setup I mainly bought the Echo plus for my kids but I‚Äôm using it more than they do Excellent product I purchased this in addition to several other Alexa products because I wanted the hub to connect several smart home devices So far it has been pretty easy to set up and use Im happy with the sound also As advertised Easy set up and integration Havent tried to use the hub yet but it is limited in the number of products it works with compared to Samsung Smartthing or Wink 2 Love the bigger speaker and the quality of sound with this product Like turning on bedroom light with Alexa I usually unplug it but when I plug it back in it is always difficult to get it reconnected to the internet for some reason I purchased this to pair with my other echo while I enjoy my other 2 echoes I must say there is a noticeably difference with the echo plus and best buy had it at a remarkable price better than amazon so it was win they amped up the speaker like the Alexa but needs to be more interactive like suri Enjoying using Alexa and love the smart home features Fun item and helpful to do things around the home I have not had a chance to use the HUB function on this device but it was easy to set up and get running still learning how to make it work with the other echo devices but overall it operates as advertised It is nice to say one set of key words and it kicks off a whole series of events Turn lights on play music etc I‚Äôm a big Apple consumer all around but after tons of research and testing I went to alexa over Siri Apple home kit to make my full home a smart house Like the idea of having a builtin hub to control other smart home devices as we get themSound quality is marginally better but we didnt buy Echos as audiophilesbut for background music and its perfect for thatMy only complaint to date is that we have to accounts in our home and Amazon Echo must have one or the other That makes it frustrating for the other user particularly when playing configuring music to play in all rooms I love my Echo so much I have my lights and front door deadbolt hooked up to it I play music from it all the time and ask Alexa about the traffic and weather I would recommend the Echo to everyone Echo plus is able to play music and response whatever answer by itself It also equip with bluetooth so I can pair to another more powerful speaker Its so convenient to askrequest without touch anything The response time is acceptable but you need to speak out your question right after calling Alex or it wont wait Great product Loving alexa Was so happy with it that know its a big part of all that i do My wife and I enjoy using Alexa for weather information and also for the great music that we are able to access We also have the light under the control of Alexa so that we never have to walk into a dark house again Has built in smart hub unlike other echos Works with other smart home devices with no additional purchases Needs some improvements on being able to answer questions but all in all its great and the sound is stellar Great price large selection Plenty to choose from I love all of the things you can do with the Echo I am still learning everything I can do and look forward to more content going forward New version is much better Integrated Hub works great and response time is better than previous Upgraded to this one from older version Responsive Bought as a Christmas gift Works good with no problems Our entire family loves Alexa and the white color looks great on our kitchen counters Very easy to use distance is sometime an issue for Alexa hearing at times Love listening to music and having it turn my light on and off No issues perfect works as advertised Perfect item for any place in your house Love the speaker and the different features it does It‚Äôs the greats Idea for your home lighting in your home or business Great product Works well and is even easy for kids to use It is a great buy The sound is great quality Deliveres what I need for a comfortable house We got this for the whole family and we are absolutely love the Alexa speaker Love that I can control my lights with the Phillips bulbs and is compatible with smart plugs to control other electronics in the house Definitely would recommend I would recommend this to anyone who like to speak commands to technology and have it respond I purchased this for my husband who is sick and he can ask for weather music sport events and more Great item Very handy to get the morning news as well as asking him to play music I‚Äôve been using the Amazon Echo from the day it was released to the market Unfortunately the volume control wheel broke I quickly went over to my local best buy and purchased the next generation There are amazing improvements concerning this device I Really And Truly Are In Love With Alexa I don‚Äôt know what I would do without her Great sound and voice recognition easy to set up and fun to use I m so happy to get this amazon echo plus Great to have it I was reluctant to purchase the Echo Plus and my best friend said to do it you will love it I did and she was so right The Philips Hue light bulb was an added bonus and love that too I never thought that buying this product was such a great step up Really makes watching a movie and turning on the TV so easy really works well with my harmony hub Love the way I can control all the lights Looking forward to all the add ons I can purchase I love this Has great sound I thought i bought in silver THe packaging was a little deceptive But Im loving it Wanting to get a second one makes things easy to control connects to other products It‚Äôs my first Alexa and I love it nice sound and smart light acts fast with command I love Alexa Has a pretty good speaker for listening toMusic and helps with my shopping lists Nice addition to the home but not essential would recommend as a gift and although I like t I could definitely live without it Product works well and is fun to use I did a fair amount of research trying to decide between this product and Googles and the reviews tend to favor the Echo I have no complaints I love it the sound is great I use it everyday for my dogs to listen to when I am at work I have an original Gen 1 Echo that has been relocated to My Bedroom by simply unplugging and Plugging back inNow that I have the Gen 2 Echo Plus in my Living Room and set up to work seamlessly with my Gen 1 I could not be happier Along with the built in Hue it makes it that much better Everything works just like I want and the sound on both devices are perfect for me this is my first experience with Alexa hard to command I guess because this is my first time I did have to reset because she stopped working I am reading up on Alexa more so I‚Äôll know how to command her This purchase is replacing an echo for that is being moved to a bedroom The sound is far superior to the dot which has decent sound The echos just keep getting better and more useful To use Putting in after Christmas Want all lights on voice activation This is great Its a lot of fun and much better than I expected The whole family uses the ECHO we love the ability to use just say Alexa and tell here what we want The youngest granddaughter loves the insult generator I love my Amazon Echo Alexa is compatible with all of my technology and super easy to use My favorite is the ease of making a grocery list and having it in the app instead of forgetting my list at home Great little speaker I use it every day and I have it about for three days already Added Alexa hub and expanded the lighting capabilities Easy setup and it works like a charm Looking for more devices to add to the mix Alexa is the greatest device to have around the house She basically runs my house for me I purchase this at the store and I was not given any bulb till I decide to do review Got this for my Dad for Christmas Awesome gift he was super excited Having fun with all the things we can learn from Alexa It is almost like having another person in the house Extra features don‚Äôt really seem worth it I would just buy the basic one instead The only thing I would say is that you have to do a work around for Direct TV other that that it is great So much fun love it I‚Äôm pretty impressed with the technology It‚Äôs a little annoying having to say Alexa all the time I‚Äôve purchases the links for the outlets and that‚Äôs all it‚Äôs really good for since the bulbs were too dim for me Bought for mother she loves it Good price in stock and an easy purchase Returned product cause I did not like it and really had no use for it Works well and the speakers decent Sounds much better than the 2nd generation of the Echo The Alexa works well and turns my lights on and off for me in bed and plays my playlist for when I sleep Very nice for the bedroom Use it in bathroom to listen to my amazon music and with Alexa you can control it with just your voice We love it The whole family likes to ask questions Still learning and figuring out all it can do for me Making our home smart and adding Echo has been great So convenient I purchased two echo dots for Black Friday once I loaded my XM I found the shortcomings The volume was not load enough Went back and picked this up and it filled up the room The dot was moved to the bedroom were it was load enough for the small room This is the hub dollar my smart devices and it worksThis is the hub dollar my smart devices and it works Have just started using Alexa and am looking forward to all the other things that are available to use with the unit i was weary about it at first but it was easy to setup and get the hang of and definitely makes life easier The amazon echo plus has worked great We like the smart bulb with the echo We are so happy with our Alexa We are very technologically challenged but she‚Äôs been great Already have the echo and dot Has good sound quality and with the hub feature you can control the hue lights with Alexa which is convenient when walking in the house with a bunch of groceries Very easy to set up Adding other accessories that it operates is easy as well Great product Friend received Amazon Echo as gift  is enjoying it I researched  decided on Echo Plus as I wanted capability to use to control home lighting Absolutely love this product It controls lights in several rooms as well as outdoor lighting Other features weather news briefs traffic are fun but the lighting control did it for me Amazon and Philips Hue work great together very easy setup The only drawback is using these bulbs on a nonPhilips dimmer switch The bulbs flicker a bit even when its set to full on This is a neat little toy It‚Äôs pretty cool that I‚Äôm able to turn the lights on and off by talking to Alexa Kinda bummed didn‚Äôt realize I bought the package and didn‚Äôt get my extra Phillips hue bulb But I love the echo plus with the hub Great product Just annoyed that the sales guy at Best Buy didn‚Äôt make sure I knew I also got a free bulb with my purchase If you want to control your light tvect with just your voice Alexa can do that and much more I have had this for around a month and i love it It makes it simple to set timers and control my lights I use Alexa for a alarm clock turning on lights when I get home and I love listening to any genre of music The speaker is loud enough to cover my room but I still connect external speakers The hub portion of the device works well although I wish it had more capabilities when it comes to controlling hue lighting super cool very interesting i have a lot of fun with it I bought the echo plus that is supposed to come with a Phillips Hue light bulb I got the echo plus but no light bulb I contacted Elite Plus and after a very long go around was told I would get a 20 credit on the best buy gift card that I used as part of the payment I was told it would take up to 15 days to get the credit why so long I was also told I would get an email stating info about the credit I still have not gotten the email I have my doubts if I will ever see the 20 put back on my gift card This is the second time I have ordered a bundle from Best Buy online and have received the main item but not the bundled items Last year I bought a friend a PS4 bundle for XMas They got the PS4 but none of the included games I had to call and get the games sent out separately I dont know what is the problem is with their online ordering when bundled items are included I am getting very wary of ordering anything online with Best Buy that I will get what I ordered on time BTW I really like the Echo Plus Just not the screw up with the shipping and the initial solution I was offered when I called customer service This works well as it was a gift and connected without issue along with the other two Great product answers all your questions and controls compatible devices Works great I am looking forward to purchase more for the diffrent rooms in my house I enjoy my new smart speaker It is a good device that I can get my pandora radio on it especially in the app Learning what the device offers for smart home besides that It is good speaker to work with different apps This is a must excellent technology Great design and sleek looks I am very happy with unit This thing works great I would recommend to all of my friends Should have bought one sooner We listen to music non stop now This doesnt require separate speakers and has great sound Love this thing  I have linked it to my Hue System and my Fire TV I ask her and she does it Fun to play games also My wife was sceptical but now she uses it more than me I like the looks of the Echo Plus and the sound from the speakers is something I didn‚Äôt expect to be as nice as it is I‚Äôm using it to tune into my favorite radio station answer any question I have to look up on the internet and assist me with lighting I am considering another for a different room My son loves it He now wants to add more for Alexa to use I like it for controlling my lights I like that we can play anyones music playlist Awesome love them had to buy 2 more for the family I love our Amazon echo plus My boyfriend says this was the best present for Christmas daily We bought this and it‚Äôs a cool tooltoy to play with We have it hook up to the lights and our appliances Now that now how to set it up I love my alexia lights Unable to try light bulb because it would not hook to echo plusWaiting for rest of system Easy to use Should have bought this a long time ago The whole family has so much fun with this we all just ask questions just to hear her give us answers haha This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my wife so I havent used it yet We do have several echo dots and we love those With it coming with hue light bulb thats an added bonus Well I bought this on a lark And to my surprise Im using it all day long to get the news alerts check the weather and listen to music Works well and even understands my relatively heavy southern accent I went into the store looking for a Bluetooth speaker for music and left with this Works great and sounds good nice and compact great sound easy to use love it Love this bot and lighting system It transforms my house into many moods Planning to get more lights and maybe another bot Love having the Echo to get quick weather reports play music and other helpful information I have several home automation devices and the Echo Plus controls all of them I was so happy with automation I bought an Echo Dot and Echo Tap having an assistant like Echo makes life so much easier Love how it hooks up to lights And can play any music Alexa is easily confused and fun to mess with but also informative when we are being serious She disappoints when she loses connection with the wifi but its not often We have 6 different Alexa products and after a few hiccups all are working well Impressed First time user of the Alexa plus Using it more and more every day Love it We had heard a lot about the Echo Plus and had seen the commercials We have not been disappointed as Alexa is a welcomed family member already  We Love Her  Love the light Its very handy to use Have them in multiple rooms It works pretty well I wish theres was an instruction book with it instead of having to go online Plus I didnt know you had to pay for music and it doesnt listen very well like it said it would Purchased Alexa Echo Plus instead of bridge for smart home Alexa is great Smart home setup was easy This is one of Good item bought for my 2017 Thanksgiving deals I wanted to try out this technology It is cool Sometimes I would prefer not to hear Alexas reply when I ask her to turn the light on I love being able to turn my lights on or off by voice It makes life a lot easier I am looking forward to finish making my home a smart home by buying other products Solid Amazon Echo love they have added Phillips Hub into the product so you do not need a hub Voice response is a little touchy compared to other Echos My son had one and whole family enjoys so bought one for my Daughter for Christmas I love my Echo Plus The hub makes it easy to add devices to my Smarthome and Alexa is a great addition It was bought as a Christmas gift so therefore no review Great gifts I have the Alexa dot in each room now this is better with the speaker base ask Alexa to play music find me recipes read the news Got this  few other dot devices to give for Xmas Easy hook up great for lights and my Sony tv I use all the time I bought this for controlling most of my Smart device No need for Philips hue bridge I still purchased bridge as I use multiple Echo dots as well My family love Alexa and so happy not having to buy any CD or another radio again The Echo and the plus are great for people not wanting to run wires And the waterpik was all we wanted I love this product just wish it was as smart as the Google home It is very convenient and fun voice comands are easy to use It plays the music you want and even reads my kindle while I cook No problem other than setup took a few minutes to finish Got it as a Christmas gift and I love it I would recommend this product The Echo Plus is a fantastically easy to use smarthome hub It is easy to setup fast and responsive has a ton of capabilities that are expanding daily and looks and sounds great I currently use mine to manage my smart ‚Äúthings‚Äù like light bulbs lamps smart switches and even my robot vac It has made automating a lot of what I do daily a breeze and has simplified my life where I didn‚Äôt know it needed to be simplifiedDefinitely worth the extra money to go with the Plus over the Echo or the Dot i have really enjoyed learning about the product and its many uses i thought initially music but now to get weather updates news receipies sports scores and ordering kitchen supplies Works great Just the beginning of my plans for a smart house Too difficult to setup not compatible with other equipment love the sound of the Echo PlusIt sounds like a stero Love how loud it get Shes prefect for everything I need We love it I find new things to do with it every day Added another echo to the family This one came with a free Philips HUE bulb on black friday which was great Alexa makes my life easy by turning my lights on and off playing my favorite music and so much more It really can control anything We know that our grandchridren are going to love themWe love ours This is a pretty good allinone starter for a smart Home set up It‚Äôs fully functional and doesn‚Äôt require a separate hub purchase for other smart Home devises This smart bulb works with Amazon echo Plus It can be turned on and off and also dimmed The echo Plus is amazing  can play music control TV and answer many questions The Echo Plus is great ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù is the best feature The only problem is you can‚Äôt use it wirelessly It must remain plugged in at all times which is kind of annoying Great improved sound and built in smart hub is so useful i purchased this to go along with my smart lights it links up right away i am satasified with this purchase WORTH IT I LOVED WELL INVESTED MONEY ALEXA HELPING ME A LOT REMINDERS LISTEN TO MUSIC AND MAKING MY HOUSE SMARTER SIMPLY AND EASY NO REGRETS I absolutely love Alexa This device is loud easy to install and does exactly what I tell her to do IFeel confident purchasing products from Best Buy due to protection coverage I bought this along with the dot and it‚Äôs helpful to use as an intercom WOW THIS IS SO MUCH FUN WOW IT CAN TELL YOU ANYTHINGPLAY ANY SONG AND MUCH MUCH MORE We love this whole system Easy to use and very useful This product works great I really enjoy having Alexa follow commands Other similar devices do not have the voice recognition learning capability the echo plus has It is superior to all the others I brought the Echo Plus for the louder sound quality I already have an Echo Dot which I use in my bedroom to control my lights and heater via a Wemo Smart Switch I brought the Echo Plus which I use in my family room for music and to control my smart devices HUB is almost useless Ended up using spare Philips HUB The HUB built in would only discover 2 out of 12 bulbs 3 days of trying HUE bridge 12 out of 12 first try Love this device performs perfectly Plays music and lures lights off and on by command love all the fun things you can do with Alexa And shes learning more everyday Bought this for my parents home and its awesome The quality of the sound is amazing Its also helpful to get quick questions answered when theyre running around or out of the house I need to now purchase one for my own apartment Also great when hosting guests Can not tell you the price of merchandise when asked It is nice to have access to the features this offers I know this makes us lazy But comes in handy when your hands are tied up with groceries or holding a baby Love that my kids ask her questions Purchased for son for xmas after experiencing the one at my other sons home So many things you can use it for Love working my lights Bought 2 as Cristmas presents for my nephews Both ages 1013 had them up and running within 20 minutes Had fun asking questions and adjusting the Philips light bulb to different brightness levels All in all it was a hit Exchanged the google Google home for this model Fun for the kids Finding new uses for it every day Had a problem when best buy forgot to include the free light bulb The speaker is an improvement over the Echo Dot set up was easy and connecting additional home automation products to it as we acquire them has been a simple process Works as advertised Have not really had a need for the HUB part yet though Love the sound I am able to plug in a lamp in a hard to reach spot since it is now voice activated This product is amazing I wasnt quite sure why everyone was going on and on about having one but now that its in my house I cannot imagine life without it Alexa not only answers my questions and gives me valuable information but now she controls the lights of my house for me I highly recommend this I have the original Echo and just purchase the Echo Plus Better speakers and can act as a hub for the Philips Hue Bulbs without having to purchase another hub Very satisfied with its performance Easy setup They are adding new commands every week it seems Still has some work till it is fully functional They make it seem like you can pretty much ask anything to Alexa but she never knows anything It is very non responsive at times too It‚Äôs fun for the family to play with but it may get boring after the newness wears off We‚Äôll see My first Alexa product and I‚Äôm going to say I‚Äôve had her for about a month and I love it have it hooked up with my Phillips hue lights works awesome Great and fun  almost like having someone in the room with you I love the Alexa It has encouraged me to automate my home Now I have lighting that comes on when I ask My heat is controlled wherever I am and its fun asking her Alexa questions Shes becoming part of the family but the Echo Plus is not much different that I have discovered yet anyway than the Echo 2nd generation I havent had the Echo 1st generation and so I do not know I have had the Echos Plus Echos2nd generation and Dot about 3 weeks and the only thing I think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality but we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume The Hue lightbulbs are great I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus further I liked it so much I went back and bought the pack of Hue bulbs that were also on sale We are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs Love it along with the Fire Stick works great Works great with the voice Alexa in itself needs lots of improvement but with philips hue and smart plugs you can have a lot of fun settings Alexa rocks The Echo Plus is super easy to set up I works great Love everything about it Adding more devices we bought this as a gift for our son he is absolutely loving it This is a great way to begin making your home a smart home Easy to set up built in hub easy to use I needed a second charger for traveling for my Kindle Fire that was a fast charger This worked great It charges my Kindle fire in just a few hours This solved the problem of my daughters lost kindle charger I found that I was immediately sked by a staff member if I needed help I received good advice and shown similar alternative products What I bought was perfect for what I wanted The price was quite reasonable Best kindle charger ever Took 30 minutes to being my kindle back to life I was looking everywhere for this because I lost my charger for my fire stick and i finally found it at best buy It was a great price and works perfectly Great product for quickly charging your Kindle I bought this because the package said it was a fast charger only to find it charges at normal speed That was disappointing Im pretty sure Im not doing anything wrong It seems pretty self explanatory  Tried different charging blocks nothing worked properly Plugged in the Amazon block Kindle came right up Quickly charges kindle so son can use it Worked great right out of the package just bought seems to be working great so far not sure how long it will last Good one and working without any issues Slim and portable This works well charges book readers quickly and easily Love it Best charger I ever bought Quickly charges my Kindle and my cell phone Have been using this item and it seems to be working quite well After purchasing 2 different brand X charges at a lower cost and having both of them fail after a couple weeks of use I purchased this OEM charger made by Amazon for our Kindle Fire Not only does it work well continuously but it fully charges the unit in a matter of 2 hours instead of overnight charging being required Still works great and well worth the few dollars extra in price Works great  got this for my kindle 7 tablet  Does an excellent job charging the kindle fire 7 a lot faster than the one it came with the kindle fire Love this base for charging my kindle You still need to use a good cord for most effective charge With a good cord and this base your kindle will charge in under 30 minutes Exactly what I needed Didnt want to settle for a generic off brand charger Thanks to Best Buy I didnt have to Bought this charger for the Kindle voyage and its great Purchased took home attached to cableplugged in Easy to use No problems using this charger'"
